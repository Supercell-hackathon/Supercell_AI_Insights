    "Game Modes and Maps": [
      "In Super City Rampage, 8-Bit's damage booster can be used as a last-resort meatshield to escape from the monster during the anger stages as the monster will attack any turrets and spawnables such as Jessie's turret andNita's Bear. Unless the monster is distracted, 8-Bit can’t escape because of his very slow movement speed.",
      "8-Bit’s is very vulnerable to fast Brawlers such asCrowandLeon. At the start of Showdown matches, focus first on defeating these Brawlers at a distance before they get closer and can deal higher damage. 8-Bit has one of the longest ranges in the game to compensate for his slow movement, so keep your distance from enemy Brawlers and out-range them, and if an enemy is chasing you, deal as much damage as you can to them from a distance to force enemy retreat. Additionally, you can also escape by using your Cheat Cartridge Gadget to teleport back to your booster and far away from enemies. However, be cautious of airborne Brawlers likeEl Primo,Surge,Mico,Crow,Gale, andEdgarwho are also fast and can close the distance with their jumps and easily defeat 8-Bit at close range.",
      "Other than his very slow movement speed, 8-Bit has all that one would require from a Brawler - high health and a high damage output, long range, a reasonable reload speed, area control, and even some support abilities, so he functions well in most game modes. However, he is most viable inHeist,Gem Grab,Hot Zone, andSiegedue to his high damage output and area control capabilities. InBounty,Showdown,Knockout, Special Events, and speed-based events such asBrawl Ball, his slow movement speed hinders his survivability, but his high health, long range, and high damage output compensates for that, making him still viable in these modes.",
      "Despite his slow movement speed, 8-Bit's high DPS and significant bulk make him a formidable area control brawler when paired with his booster. As such, 8-Bit can be an excellent goalkeeper in more open Brawl Ball maps and can assist in chipping away at enemy health in Knockout should one be cautious with aiming him. During the latter, hide behind your turret as much as possible since the snipers commonly used in Knockout are unable to pierce."
    ],
    "Recommended Build": [
      "8-Bit's Cheat Cartridge Gadget can be used to rush and surprise an enemy by throwing his booster over the wall towards the enemy before teleporting to attack them with increased damage, since he normally can’t rush an enemy due to his very slow movement speed. It can also be used to escape enemies by teleporting away if you're low on health or if you’re being cornered.",
      "8-Bit's Extra Credits Gadget combined with his Super would deal enough damage to eliminate almost all Brawlers in-game without losing ammo, but it can be easily avoided. Use it on modes with stationary targets like Heist and Siege, with it dealing devastating damage to these above examples. You may also use it in Special Events to deal extra damage to the Bosses in each event, but note that mobility is very important in Super City Rampage and might justify the usage of Cheat Cartridge.",
      "8-Bit's slow speed makes him vulnerable to being unable to retreat and heal. As such, the recommended gears to equip are the Health and Speed Gears, allowing for 8-Bit to heal up or reach the locations he needs to be in much faster. Alternatively, in maps with choke points the Reload Gear can be used instead, allowing 8-Bit to constantly mow down opponents.",
      "8-Bit’s most valuable asset is his sheer damage, so oftentimes the Damage Gear is best for him to optimize the amount of damage he can deal, especially considering his decent health pool. As 8-Bit’s slow unload speed makes him vulnerable to being rushed down and defeated by Brawlers with quick unload speeds, this Gear would also allow 8-Bit to defeat opponents with as little bullets as possible, or at least make them easier for teammates to take down if he is defeated."
    ],
    "Strategies": [
      "An effective trap you can use, especially in Showdown, is to place your booster so that one side is behind a wall and a bush and the other is out in the open. When an enemy Brawler comes to destroy your booster, you can use your Cheat Cartridge Gadget to rush in and quickly eliminate the enemy, and if the enemy manages to destroy it, the damage dealt would’ve charged your Super back again,  so you can pull off the trap again. If it’s a Brawler with moving abilities (Edgar, El Primo, Crow, etc.), use your long range to your advantage and aim your attack onto them if they do escape with their ability. This ensures them on low health or even defeats them.",
      "It is typically a good idea to place your booster behind a wall (unless attacking where you can tank damage with the booster) because it’ll be harder to destroy it. This is even more effective with Boosted Booster as it can provide more area of damage boost when keeping the booster behind a wall makes it hard to stay near it. However, this strategy is countered by throwers,Squeak, andMicoas they can hit the booster regardless of any walls in their way.",
      "Thanks to the slight spread of his attacks, 8-Bit does not fare well against long-ranged sharpshooters and marksmen as his bullets are less accurate at a distance. As such, prioritise attacking mid to short ranged brawlers first to build up your Super, before deploying it to act as a shield and increase the damage of your bullets against longer-ranged brawlers.",
      "While 8-Bit is bulky, has good range and deals decent damage, his slow speed and inconsistent accuracy at his range's peak make him unsuitable for leading pushes against opposing teams. As such, try to stay slightly behind and offer additional chip damage while you charge your Super, or sneak up via bushes and finish off weakened brawlers.",
      "In Hot Zone maps such asRing of Fire, 8-Bit's damage and the choke points present allow him to function as a sort of pseudo-assassin. As such, you should give your booster to your teammates on the Hot Zone while 8-Bit remains in the bushes to ambush opposing brawlers attempting to make a push.",
      "8-Bit’s slow unload speed makes him vulnerable to assassins or brawlers with quick firing rates like Max and Edgar. As such, try to stay in the open to maintain range superiority and avoid walls from which they can rush you."
    ],
    "Other": [
      "The most important thing to do when playing as 8-Bit is to charge and activate his Super. His Super can control a large area and can easily allow you and allies to deal large amounts of damage to enemies. If your Super is taken down, focus on charging up a second Super and pushing back enemies.",
      "If you are low on health and someone is chasing you, you can place your booster down to tank some shots so you can escape more easily. Keep in mind, this won’t be effective againstPenny,Jessie,Surge,Belle,Carl,Draco,Mr. P,Brock, or any other Brawler with mechanics that can deal damage to multiple enemies, as their projectiles won’t be fully blocked. Also, note that this should be a last-resort action, as he depends on his booster quite a lot.",
      "Due to 8-Bit's slow movement speed, dodging projectiles from other sharpshooters like Colt or throwers likeBarleyis difficult. So dealing damage behind cover or from afar is recommended as the enemies won’t be able to hit him as easily. This can be compensated with his Plugged In Star Power or other speed boosts, as 8-Bit can fight the fast and long-ranged Brawlers with ease that he’s usually prone to in Showdown. It can also be very useful to control, retreat, and reach a target in most 3v3 modes and special events. Though, Boosted Booster is preferred inRobo Rumble,Boss Fight, andSuper City Rampage, where speed is less beneficial.",
      "Byroncan use his healing abilities to further justify 8-Bit's already high health at a range, and 8-Bit's Super can boost Byron's healing, so they have a great synergy together. This can also lead to devastating results in Siege if 8-Bit and Byron can remain concealed up to the corners closest to the enemy IKE. 8-Bit must place his booster down to boost his damage and Byron’s healing, and Byron heals 8-Bit while 8-Bit deals damage to the IKE, especially with his Extra Credits Gadget. High-damaging Brawlers likeAmber,Spike,Griff,Meeple,Rico,Leon, andColtalso work well with 8-Bit and help him get the most out of the booster.",
      "When on low health and hiding in a bush, try not to place your Super when the Plugged In Star Power is equipped as the speed boost effect indicator coming from the Super can give away your location. However, if your plan is to escape rather than hide, you may place your Super to tank shots and speed you up."

      "Amber's Super and Fire Starters Gadget can provide area control, making her niche in events likeGem GrabandHot Zone. She can place her puddles over the Gem mine or a zone and prohibit enemies from achieving the respective event objective. If an enemy attempts to cross the puddle, she can ignite it to deal significant damage to the enemy. In addition, the puddles from her Super and Fire Starters Gadget can connect to create an extremely large puddle to control massive areas. The area control provided from the puddles is amplified with her Wild Flames Star Power. You can either connect the puddles to clear bushes or separate them to allow for select area denial."
    ],
    "Recommended Build": [
      "Amber's Dancing Flames Gadget can deal incredible damage if all fireballs hit the target, so it gives her sturdy protection against assassin Brawlers or Brawlers with Supers that could fly over obstacles that would normally defeat Amber (e.g.El Primo,Surge,Mico, andEdgar). She can also use this Gadget effectively in modes likeHeist, where there is a stationary target. This allows her to deal massive damage with this Gadget, and combined with her piercing attack, Super, and Gadget Gear, she is a menace in such modes.",
      "Amber's Wild Flames Star Power and Fire Starters Gadget are extremely useful in helping Amber quickly regain her Super, especially when Supers are most necessary. With her Fire Starters Gadget, she can create a large puddle area in which her Super recharges, allowing for an insane pace of Supers while fighting.",
      "Trails from Amber's Fire Starters Gadget can also be used as firewalls to protect you and allies. Make sure to keep puddles connected so enemies, especially heavyweights and assassins, are damaged when crossing the puddles."
    ],
    "Strategies": [
      "Amber is an excellent cover destroyer that can burn down a large amount of bushes from her fire puddles and her attack combined while also being able to inflict burn damage, restricting an enemy's ability to heal and retreat.",
      "Be careful about positioning Amber's Super because if it's thrown in an undesirable position, you might accidentally ignite the puddle when attacking an enemy near it, so try to place the fluid outside your attacking spot but still in your range so you can ignite the puddle at the right time. This also enables you to control two lanes at once.",
      "Try to predict the enemy's movement in order to land more shots, because there's a tiny yet noticeable delay between aiming and firing. You'll deal maximum damage by aiming where the enemy is likely to move as aiming at the enemy's current position won't damage the moving enemy since Amber's flames travel slowly.",
      "Amber is an excellent counter to high-health Brawlers because her continuous attack deals enough damage to eliminate them. She can also use her Super to prevent them from healing and finish them off. However, maintain your distance from these Brawlers because Amber, with her moderate health, can be two-shotted or three-shotted by those Brawlers if they get close enough, and she's helpless at close range due to her inability to deal immediate damage and her lack of stuns, slows, or knockbacks to distance herself from such Brawlers.",
      "Try not to waste ammo with Amber. If Amber is out of ammo, she needs to wait a while to fully reload despite what seems to be an incredibly fast reload speed. With her Scorchin' Siphon Star Power, you can partially mitigate this issue by using her Super or her Fire Starters Gadget to reload quicker. You can also place her Fire Starters Gadget at your spawn point and reload quicker if you die. If you do this you will enter battle with a full ammo bar.",
      "If you have the Wild Flames Star Power, when you get your Super and throw it, sometimes it is a better idea to wait and keep the Super on the ground so that you charge up more of your Super. This is a good strategy in passive maps and also good if you aren't going to hit an enemy with it, as you can charge another Super.",
      "Amber's fire fluid can be ignited before it fully spills on the ground which can be used to give enemies no time to escape the fire fluid's radius."

    "Recommended Build": [

      "Master Fletcher can be used as a surprise attack to enemies hiding behind walls. However, the use of this Gadget is limited and doesn't provide as much value as Stinging Flight in most cases.",

This makes it valuable in games where there is no healer in the team or when their second Star Power is ineffective.",

      "When facing enemies with low health, Angelo can get closer to make sure their fully charged shot hits to defeat the enemy. It is not always necessary to stay very far since their health is fairly high when compared with other marksman Brawlers.",
      "To help teammates finish off enemies, you may get close to enemies to fire their fully charged shot and jump away using their Stinging Flight Gadget.",
      "When facing an enemy Angelo, walk in a zig-zag pattern with sudden stops so that the enemy will be less likely to hit you.",
      "When approaching a target, don't aim directly at them as they may anticipate the direction of your shot. As such, try to either aim backwards before snapping forwards or spin about, with the latter being effective at keeping teams of enemies on edge.",
      "When using the Master Fletcher Gadget, fully charge your shot, and then activate the Gadget right before releasing the shot, as this can catch many people off guard, which makes it very hard to dodge.",
      "In Heist, you can use a Stinging Flight Gadget to go on to the safe, and then use a Super which will deal 8000 damage, which can be game-changing in close games."
    ],
    "Other": [
      "Angelo's attack does not have to be fully charged to deal significant damage. Charging it up to around 70% will be sufficient enough to threaten enemies in order to stay at long range.",
      "As Angelo's fully charged shot can deal high damage and even defeat Brawlers with one shot (especially paired with the Super), you should pay attention to when their shot changes in color in order to dodge effectively.",
      "Angelo can leave their Super's area of effect for a very small amount of time and still have poisoned arrows. Same thing for when the duration ends.",

      "Ash is strong in modes and maps that require constant area control. His high health allows him to withstand a healthy amount of damage, and once his rage bar is filled, he can deal very high damage to enemies. This allows him to go aggressive with his improved speed and damage, and possibly turn the outcome of the match. However, this also means he is somewhat ineffective in modes and strategies that require high burst-damage or quick maneuvering.",
      "Ash is a good pick inBrawl Ball. His short range is compensated in manyBrawl Ballmaps that have a lot of bushes or walls, which can help him sneak up on enemies or retreat. His high health and fast movement speed renders him an excellent ball holder, and with his super and attacks, he can fill up his rage bar quickly. Once he does fill up his rage bar, he can go aggressive on enemies with his high-damaging attack and very fast movement speed. It is important to remember that while Ash can deal a huge amount of potential damage, his output is inconsistent, and sometimes the better thing might be to retreat rather than rushing forward. Ash can also be a lot more reliable if paired with a healer, as goes for all tanks. Once Ash's survivability improves, he can regularly deal damage and fill up his rage bar."

Because of this, it's best to use this Gadget with full Rage, with low health, and with a close-ranged enemy chasing you so that you can use your Gadget to heal significantly and then attack the enemy while also recharging your Rage and forcing the enemy to flee. You may also gain your Rage back by using your Super after you heal as the rats will recharge his Rage significantly, or by hitting the enemies with the First Bash Star Power (while having all of his ammo).",
      "Ash with his Rotten Banana Gadget is strong when paired with a healer such asByron,Pam,Doug,Berry, orPoco.

      "The most important thing you need to do while playing Ash is to charge up his Rage bar as Ash also needs his Rage to match other heavyweights on damage. Normally, Ash deals moderately low damage and has a normal movement speed but better potential can be extracted by filling up his Rage bar. Because Ash has a short range, it's best to deal or take damage in enclosed areas due to the abundance of cover that allows Ash to attack enemies with ease or to heal up.",

When facing these Brawlers, attack them with the tip of Ash's range so that they can't hit all of their projectiles and defeat him easily.",
      "Though Ash's attack and Super charge his Rage significantly, his short attack range makes charging his Rage and Super quite difficult to do. Because of this, you should head to choke points because enemies will usually be bunched up in those areas and Ash can charge his Rage significantly by attacking all the enemies or by using his First Bash Star Power to charge more of his Rage.",
      "Be wary when taking damage to charge your Rage because while it can be charged significantly from taking little damage, taking too much damage can leave you more vulnerable.",

As such, try to wait until all enemy teammates are present before throwing down his Hypercharged Super, maximising the disruption caused, allowing easy Rage recharge and even team wipes.Since his Hypercharge recharges so much Rage, it's recommended that Ash uses his Gadget Chill Pill before throwing down his Super, seeing as it's almost guaranteed to recharge the Rage he's lost.",

      "Barley can be effective inHeist, if used correctly. Barley's Super has an incredibly long range, allowing it to safely deal damage to the Heist safe. Since the safe is a stationary target, it’ll take both ticks of damage from his main attack as well as all four ticks from his Super.",
      "Barley is a greatSiegeBrawler mainly because he’s a control Brawler, excellent at area denial. He can force the enemies back with his long-lasting attacks and Super so that his team can retrieve the Bolts. When playing Barley inSiege, try to stay alive when yourSiegeBot spawns. Barley is usually the primary damage dealer to the IKE. Additionally, Barley's Super has an extremely long range, making it able to reach the IKE without entering its range.",
      "Barley is a menace inDuo Showdownif he is paired with a heavyweight such asDarryl,El Primo,Rosa,Frank,Bibi,Hank,Ash,Jacky,Draco,Ollie,Buster, orBull. You can follow your teammate around and use Barley's attack to damage enemies while the tank finishes them off. The same applies to Power Cubes; if there are multiple boxes near your spawn, you can use your attacks to break them by stacking their damage."

Surprisingly, you can use this to bush-camp with Barley. Hide in a bush, and when an enemy walks by, use your Sticky Syrup Mixer Gadget to slow them and burst them down. If done correctly, this either takes out the enemy or deals tremendous amounts of damage, forcing them to retreat. Barley's Sticky Syrup Mixer Gadget is especially useful against tanks and close-ranged assassins since it usually slows them down enough to where Barley can out-range and deal a large amount of damage to them.When enemies are behind a wall, Barley can use his Sticky Syrup Mixer Gadget to slow them down. Then, he can follow up with three attacks to take them out. This close-range strategy works even better with bushes, where his damage is surprisingly high.",

      "His Medical Use Star Power is more map-dependent, best used in game modes where controlling the field is more important than eliminating enemy Brawlers. This includes events such as Gem Grab, Heist, and Siege. Medical Use increases his survivability, allowing you to continuously attack instead of retreating, and giving up ground to heal up. This Star Power can be paired with his Herbal Tonic Gadget to provide healing when there aren't other healers on your team.",
      "Barley's Extra Noxious Star Power allows Barley's attacks to deal more damage. This makes Barley to become a more aggressive Brawler, especially from behind walls. This Star Power enables Barley to become very strong on modes like Heist and Siege."

      "Like most other throwers, aiming two attacks at an enemy, two on either side of them, will force them to move up or down, potentially making it easier to separate them from their allies. They can also choose to move into the attacks and force them to take damage from Barley's attacks.",
      "Combining Barley's Super withSpike's can deal huge damage to enemies trapped by both. Spike's Super slows the enemy's movement speed and deal damage, hindering them from escaping while Barley's Super deals massive damage.",
      "Barley's attack can be used for area control, deeming it effective to discourage enemy movement through certain choke points or paths. Take advantage of this to keep enemies out of critical areas of the map, such as the Gem mine inGem Grab, the zones inHot Zone, or the Bolts inSiege."

      "LikeDynamike,Tick,Grom,Berry,Willow,Juju,Larry & Lawrie, andSprouthis attacks can be lobbed over obstacles. It’s recommended to attack from behind walls where the enemies can’t hit you as easily than if you’re out in the open. It is even better to attack from behind unbreakable walls where enemies cannot destroy your cover.",
      "Barley's Super can deal massive amounts of damage if an enemy is unable to quickly escape from the liquid. Try to aim the Super to have it land within the enemy standing in the middle of it or trapped against a wall, and use your Sticky Syrup Mixer Gadget to prolong and maximize your damage output.",
      "Auto-aiming with Barley often causes you to miss your shot or only deal 1 tick of damage. Because Barley's attacks last for two ticks, if you aim the shot in front of where an enemy will head, you’ll either hinder their movement or cause them to take two ticks of damage."

      "Bea is a good choice in open maps. As a shooter, she can deal high damage from afar, but she lacks a failsafe escape method that could protect her from assassins. This means she requires an assassin or close-range Brawler that could protect her if such an situation occurred.",
      "Bea is a viable counter against tanks. Since most tanks are close-ranged, in order to deal effective damage, they would have to get close up to other team. Bea's slowing Super and Gadget can be effective in this place, and she is able to shoot them down without getting hurt herself. However, a lot of tanks have Supers or Gadgets that can allow them to travel a distance, therefore closing up with Bea. In this case, it would be a good idea to team her with a Brawler that can protect her if she is threatened (i.e.BusterorShelly)."

      "It is a good choice to place Bea's Honey Molasses Gadget behind a wall in order to make it harder for enemies to destroy the beehive, as it has very low health. Alternatively, you can use it as a shield to tank some damage if you find yourself in a desperate situation where you need to escape quickly with their remaining health. This can also slow down chasing Brawlers, helping you escape.",
      "Honey Molasses can be very effective in closing off certain chokepoints in the map that can help your team with area control. For example, inHot Zone, you could put the Gadget down on a lane that the other team must or should pass in order to reach the zone. This can prevent them from reaching it in time or force them to choose another lane, giving your team an advantage on taking them down and gaining control of the zone. The same could be said for other modes.",
      "Bea's Rattled Hive Gadget is very unpredictable and hard to dodge if players are dealing with other threats. Because the bees move faster and do more damage at a longer range, it is more advisable to use this Gadget offensively for massive area denial and damage potential than to use it defensively. It can also be used to check bushes that are behind walls and damage throwers hiding behind walls."
    ],
    "Strategies": [
      "Bea has only one ammo slot and low health, so she can be ambushed easily. It is advised not to stay too close to bushes that cover a large area like inCavern Churn, because close-ranged Brawlers and assassins such asShelly,Bull,Darryl,Edgar,Leon,Buzz,El Primo, orFangcan be great counters and can inflict lots of burst damage if they have been bush-camping or behind walls nearby, and assassins can dodge your shots easily with their fast movement speed and/or fast Supers (i.e.Stu,Mortis,Mico,Crow, andMelodie).",
      "Usually, most Brawlers are fast enough to be able to dodge Bea's shots. However, upon hitting a Brawler with her Super, it is possible to auto-aim them down very quickly without aiming as the Brawler is slowed down and unable to move fast enough to dodge her shots. Keep in mind that Brawlers with movement speed boosts from Star Powers or Supers might still be able to dodge auto-aimed shots.",
      "Bea’s Super projectiles spread out in a wide cone, which allows them to hit enemies around walls. It's useful for discouraging enemies from afar and defeating enemies that are close to you.",
      "If you're not sure whether a Bea has a Supercharged shot or not, you can check the bee flying close to her. If it's glowing red (for enemies) or blue (for you/allies), that shows a Supercharged shot is ready. Her ammo bar will also turn yellow instead of the usual orange.",

      "Since Bea's Super spreads out, it is great for checking bushes when you know an enemy Brawler is hiding, but the area the bush covers is too large for her normal attack.",

      "Take into consideration that while it only takes four attacks to charge Bea's Super, her normal shot and Supercharged shot have the same Super charge.",

      "Belle is a very consistent damage dealer, compared to other shooters likeAngelo,Piper, orBea. However, she has almost nothing to protect herself, and given her low hit points and insufficient burst damage, she can be easily defeated by assassins and close-range Brawlers once they get in range. This means she would require help from her teammates if such an occasion occurred.",
      "Belle is a good Brawler in Showdown maps with the Angry RoboModifier. She can attack the robot if its following a Brawler and the attack will keep bouncing between the robot and the Brawler for a sufficient amount of time, thus causing the Brawler to have less health or even get defeated. It's less effective against Brawlers with moving abilities likeSurge,Carl,Edgar,Berry,Fang,Bull,El Primo,Crow,Piper,Buzz, orDarrylwho can escape."
    ],
    "Recommended Build": [
      "Both of Belle's Gadgets are usable. Overall, Nest Egg gives more value to the team as she can place it in important chokepoints and lanes. Once an enemy steps on it, they will be slowed, giving Belle and her teammates plenty of time to defeat them. Reverse Polarity is somewhat restrained as it is only efficient for a single shot.  However, she can use it to hit enemies who might be too far to reach by bouncing her shot, which gives her extra range. Still, unless it is used precisely and timely, Reverse Polarity is usually not as useful as Nest Egg.",
      "Although both Star Powers are usable, Positive Feedback is a better (most of the time). While Grounded can be useful in certain situations (i.e. by using it on a close-range Brawler once they have used their shots), Belle engages best in long-range interactions. When against shooters, the effect of this Star Power is infinitely decreased as long-range Brawlers typically require aiming and precise timing of their shots. This means that enemies will not be spamming their shots, and the five seconds debuff doesn't really do that much to alter the course of the battle. Positive Feedback, in the other hand, is much easier to acquire as all you need to do is to hit your shots. Combined with her long range, fast projectile speed and bouncing mechanic, she is able to keep her shield through most of the battle. The shield is very effective for many interactions, as it increases her survivability and allows her to stay in battle for a longer time. This makes it a clear choice in most scenarios.",
      "Belle's Positive Feedback Star Power's duration doesn't stack, so conserving shots is better to prolong the shield. The 20% shield gives her health equivalent toColette, and since she doesn't have a guaranteed way to push away rushing Brawlers, conserving shots to prolong the shield gives you a better chance of surviving. This gives Belle a very good advantage in 1v1 interactions with other shooters as her survivability is increased with the shield while the enemy's health is decreased with the extra damage from her super.",
      "Belle's Nest Egg Gadget is great to trap choke-points on maps such asCavern Churn,Gem Fort, orAcid Lakesas it can force Brawlers to walk over her traps, giving the opportunity for a good ambush. Belle's Nest Egg Gadget can also be used for maximum effect inHot Zone, where it can be used to maintain zone control by trapping it and make enemies vulnerable to being slowed and being eliminated by allies. Enemies that aren't tanks or assassins or don't have moving abilities can't travel around it and will have to step on them, guaranteeing ambushes."

    "Strategies": [
      "Belle's Super can be incredibly powerful on Special Events such asBoss Fight,Super City Rampage, orBig Gameas it highly increases your whole party's damage against the Boss.",
      "Always take advantage of grouped-up enemies, boxes, or spawns. Belle can also use her Nest Egg Gadget to keep enemies close enough for her attack to bounce more.",
      "The boosted damage on enemies hit by Belle's Super makes her an ideal counter to tanks. The damage boost allows her teammates and her to deal enough damage to eliminate tanks. This also works to get rid of Brawlers with a very high amount of Power Cubes inShowdown, who can prove challenging to defeat in the later stages of the game where she is limited by poison clouds to maintain her distance from enemies. However, you must maintain your distance from tanks as much as you can due to their superior health and close-ranged damage.",
      "Belle's low health means that getting close to enemies is not a viable option, similar toPiper. However, unlike Piper, who has her Super to escape from close-ranged Brawlers if it's charged up, Belle doesn't have much to defend herself at close range, so she's vulnerable to heavyweights or assassins. If you're running away from such a Brawler, you can lay your Nest Egg Gadget behind you to deter them from reaching you as disarming the Gadget is not possible without getting slowed. Additionally, if you have her Super charged, you can fire her Super onto the enemy so they receive more damage, and with her Grounded Star Power, momentarily disarms them. If you don't have her Nest Egg Gadget or your Super charged up, try to predict where the heavyweight or assassin will go, and stay mobile to ensure they can't reach you.",
      "Belle has one of the longest consistent ranges in the game. You can use this to your advantage to keep your distance and poke at Brawlers. Because of the bouncing, enemies are forced to separate and you and/or your team can trap and defeat them individually, leading the enemies into an uncomfortable situation and position. Her passive chaining bolts and their bounces force enemies to distance themselves, making them vulnerable to assassins who can pick them off individually. This allows her to combo well with assassin Brawlers likeEdgar,Fang,Mico,Leon, orCordelius."

This makes her an excellent goalkeeper of some sort because she can protect the goal as well as grab the ball and kick it away with her fast movement speed and fast reload speed. In addition, both of her Star Powers are useful in Brawl Ball. Her Home Run Star Power allows Bibi to reach the ball or reach the enemy team's goal much faster when her Home Run Bar is full. Her Batting Stance Star Power allows her to take less damage, which is useful when enemies are attempting to steal the ball from her or when she needs to walk the ball into the enemy goal. In addition, Bibi is also useful for pushing forward on the enemy team, as when her Home Run Bar is full, she can push the enemies back, leaving them little room to defend your attack.",

Most likely, one of your teammates will stay at your payload to gain progress, but if not then stay at your cart and always try to stay behind your cart as Bibi’s attack can go through the Payload, likeJacky‘s attack. When Bibi’s Home Run Bar is fully charged, this can help prevent enemies from getting to your cart or stop their own progression.",

She can use the Gadget to get back into the fight fast, or use it when fighting Brawlers with insufficient burst damage at melee range. While Extra Sticky can slow down enemies, her super is usually not used as a long-range aggressive projectile due to its somewhat slow travel speed and inefficient damage. Even if the enemy is slowed, Bibi struggles to get up close to them, especially if she is facing long-ranged Brawlers likePiper,Brock,Angelo,Bea,Colt,Rico,Mandy, andNani, who can deal significant damage from afar and protect themselves if Bibi gets close. Overall, Vitamin Booster is a better choice.",
      "Both Star Powers are useful. Home Run can improve Bibi's movement speed significantly, make it a good choice inBrawl Balland other modes where speed is required.

      "As Bibi's attack requires a while for its full animation to take place, in Brawl Ball you can time your attack animation to begin just as you pick up the ball, essentially allowing you to deal damage while maintaining control. This is effective if you are facing off aggressive opponents at low health, and if your Home Run bar is full, it is also useful to fend off tanks such as Bull, whose play styles mainly revolve around quick assassinations and thus are likely to be near unattended balls, especially in bushes.",
      "Using her Super directly after starting the swing to knock an enemy back can result in the bubble hitting them twice, usually securing a defeat against low-health Brawlers. The timing is difficult and requires practice.",
      "When fighting another Bibi, you can start your attack before you get in range, and because Bibi's attack takes time to take effect, you can knockback or hit the opposing Bibi before their swing goes off. You can see that the enemy Bibi's Brawler model leans a little as the enemy starts to attack, which you can use to help time your attack or to retreat. This same mechanic of knocking the enemy back before you get in range can be applied when fighting other Brawlers. It takes a bit of practice to learn the correct timing, but using this trick greatly increases your skill and ability with Bibi."

    "Other": [
      "Bibi's ability to knock enemies back when her Home Run bar is charged can be used to avoid contact from short-ranged Brawlers, which allows you to escape, and to stop dangerous attacks and Supers before they fully execute, like the Supers ofFrankandCarl.",
      "Knocking enemies back can also be a disadvantage if she pushes them away from enemy fire, especially for medium to long-ranged Brawlers who can still hit her from that greater distance, and it’s especially dangerous to you for certain Brawlers that deal more damage in mid-long range such asEmz. It is useful to work out in advance if using the knockback is beneficial in a certain situation, and to either discard the knockback by attacking the air, or conserving ammo and storing the knock back ability. You can deliberately discard your knockback from a charged Home Run bar by swinging Bibi's bat prematurely, if your next move is to only attack enemies which you don't want to knockback. In order to avoid helping a target escape from her Home Run’s knockback, Bibi can knock them into a nearby wall and then go up to them and defeat them.",
      "Bibi's knockback, just likeGale’s Super, can be used to push enemies away from vital objectives of the gamemode or pushing enemies away from teammates. For example, she can knock defending enemies away from either yours or the enemies' safe inHeist, she can knock back the bot inSiegeor knock enemies' away from their IKE, to knock enemies' away from the bolts in Siege, knock enemies' away the the goal or ball inBrawl Ball, the zone inHot Zone, the gems inGem Grab, or the blue star inBounty.",
      "If aimed correctly, Bibi's Super can repeatedly bounce off walls to deal a lot of damage to a safe in walled maps such asTurnaround. Her Super is also able to bounce off of the other wall edge and hit an IKE turret twice in Siege while being out of the IKE’s range. Her Super is also useful to defeat low-health Brawlers."

With Bo's Snare a Bear, Bo's traps will instead stun, giving you ample time to quickly defeat opponents without any risk of dying, making this effective in Knockout,Lone Star, and Bounty. InDuo Showdown, Bo can be used with a high-damaging Brawler, such asBuzz,Darryl,Bull,Fang,Doug,El Primo,Griff,Leon,Frank,Spike, orShellyto finish off a stunned enemy.",
      "Bo's fairly high health can be used to walk the Ball into the enemy goal in Brawl Ball. In addition, Bo's traps can be used to destroy enemy cover and goalposts. Clearing up certain maps could be beneficial due to Bo's relatively long range, especially if he has teammates with long-ranged abilities. Hence, Bo is a viable Brawler in Brawl Ball."

      "When Bo's Super is used, the third trap is set slightly after the other two. Thus, activating Bo's Tripwire Gadget immediately after using his Super only explodes two traps. In Brawl Ball, this can be used to explode walls or obstacles in front of the enemies' goal effectively, which makes it much easier to score. This also leaves one trap hidden until an enemy steps on it, so you can use the last trap for other strategies such as bait for the Ball.",
      "When an enemy tries to disarm your traps, use Bo's Tripwire Gadget to catch them off guard and deal instant damage. Coupled with Bo's second Star Power, Bo can passively force enemies to not disarm his mines. This allows him to control open areas simply by selecting this Gadget.",
      "Bo's Circling Eagle is really useful on maps filled with bushes, with his doubled radius of vision in bushes. Some maps includeCavern Churn,Feast or Famine,Island Invasion,Snake Prairie, andSapphire Plains. Since you have a sight advantage, avoid getting close to tanks or other high-damaging Brawlers. Place his traps to cover the lane with only one passageway while you can cover the other side with your increased sight. When played properly, Bo can quite easily dominate bushy maps. This is really useful in 3v3, for his increased sight in bushes is shared with teammates too.",
      "Bo's Snare a Bear Star Power can come into great effect in several Special Events. If one is stunned, you and your teammates can deal massive damage to them temporarily without being targeted. This includes the Bosses inSuper City Rampage,Robo RumbleandBoss Fight."

    "Strategies": [
      "Bo's traps can be effectively lobbed over walls, making them an excellent tool for countering Brawlers hidden in bushes on the other side of a barrier. By strategically tossing a trap just ahead of their hiding spot, you can force them to walk into it, as they lack the ability to cross the wall unless they are airborne or equipped with a destructive Super. Additionally, with the Tripwire Gadget, you can inflict immediate damage on your unsuspecting opponent.",
      "Bo always shoots three arrows from left to right, so you can take advantage of this to control the spread of your arrows. If you want to concentrate fire in a small area, move left while firing, allowing more arrows to hit a single target. For an attack with more spread, move right. The space between each arrow will be increased, giving the attack a wider spread. However, the former strategy only works on stationary targets as Brawlers will most likely be moving and can thus dodge all three arrows."

      "Bo's Super can be used to defend critical areas and choke points on the battlefield. Enemies heading in the area will take high damage when they step on the traps. It can be utilized to cover the Gem mine inGem Grabto damage enemy Brawlers who are gathering Gems from it. It can also be used to cover key choke points inShowdown, zone(s) inHot Zoneand Bolt spawning areas inSiege, making Bo an ideal control Brawler.",

Damage, on the other hand, helps her deal extra damage in her cannon form, seeing how much health she has in her Clyde form, and helps her deal a lot of extra damage in her close range Bonnie form, since she acts like an assassin.",
      "Easily the better build, Black Powder Star Power and Sugar Rush Gadget make up for Bonnie's movement weakness immensely, being almost essential to playing the usually slow yet assassin-like Brawler. This is mainly because Wisdom Tooth, which never hits and deals almost no damage, and Crash Test, where Bonnie is almost never in launched form due to Super recharge, have zero niche or main usage."

      "In Bonnie's cannon form, she can pressure enemies due to her long attack range and high health. In her alternate form, Bonnie can pick off enemy Brawlers with her high burst damage. But since she has a short range in her alternate form, her Super with her Black Powder Star Power allows her to get close to enemies. Try not to rush into a group of enemies in Bonnie's alternate form, as despite having a very fast movement speed, her short range and moderately low health makes it risky to run away from or towards enemy Brawlers, who could easily corner or outrange her.",
      "In her Bonnie form, Bonnie has very slow reload speed and short range, so it is a bad idea to waste ammo to \"tag\" or intimidate an opponent if you are under attack.",
      "Bonnie's attacks are similar toBo's attacks. Bonnie shoots three bombs from left to right, so you can take advantage of this to control the spread of the bombs. If you want to concentrate fire in a small area, move left while firing, allowing more arrows to hit a single target. For an attack with more spread, move right. The space between each bomb will be increased, giving the attack a wider spread.",
      "Even though it seems counter-intuitive, Bonnie should transform into cannon form even if she is currently fighting someone. She can continue charging her Super to escape, heals a bit to gain an edge, and with her Sugar Rush gadget, she can quickly out-distance the attacker.",
      "Use the Cannon form if you're fighting against long-range enemies, as it gives you a long range and high health. Conversely, it is better to use the alternate form when fighting short-range enemies, as they usually have high health and the alternate form does a lot of damage. If they hit you, you can quickly escape because of her high movement speed.",

One advantage over his Super is that you can better predict the amount of walls Brock's Gadget will destroy as opposed to his Super, which only shows the area-of effect of possible missile hits which is harder to control. However, unlike his super, this shot can be body-blocked by enemies or spawnables (such as the shadows fromTara's Support from Beyond), as the attack does not pierce. However, if your target is standing near their spawnables, the small explosion radius ensures they will still get damaged.",

You can also use this in Heist if you happen to be fairly low on health whilst approaching the safe to incinerate the enemy safe. While he is the Boss inBig Game, you can also use this as an extra boost to his damage output, though being the Boss already boosts your reload speed tremendously.",

He can also self-pass, by kicking the Ball forward and charging towards it, then attempting to score. However, avoid using your Super to make enemies lose the ball by knocking them back, as he can break your team's goalpost and other vital walls, as this only assists the enemies and allows them freely to retrieve the ball and score.

      "Bull's Berserker Star Power is especially effective inHeistmode because it increases his attack speed when his health drops below 40%, allowing him to deal massive damage to the enemy safe. This rapid firing lets Bull unload a large amount of damage in a short period, making him a key asset for quickly chipping away at the safe’s health. With his tanky health pool, Bull can survive long enough to deal damage to the safe, ensuring he's consistently a threat during critical moments of the match.",

Make sure to aim you Super correctly and predict the enemy's movement, so you can reach the enemy properly to defeat them, or use his Stomper Gadget to get as close as possible to the enemy. Bull's Super can also come in handy when Bull needs to escape from enemies if in danger because of his Super's long charging distance, which is useful inBountywhen overwhelmed by enemies. However, he's not impervious to damage while charging, so be wary of nearby enemies.

Take advantage of bushes, obstacles, or thin choke points to ambush and defeat enemies. Therefore, in more open areas or maps, try to dodge enemy attacks. Bull has a higher movement speed than most Brawlers so he can rush enemies and avoid their attacks more easily. It's ideal to dodge enemy attacks and not tank damage, as that allows enemies to quickly charge their Supers.",

    "Game Modes and Maps": [
      "Buzz's mechanics make him viable inHeist. He can grapple onto the enemy safe and stun nearby defenders, eliminate them, and proceed to deal large amounts of damage to the safe continuously since his reload speed is fast. He can also use the stun from his Super to defeat attackers onto his team's safe, and his moderately high health allows for more survivability while attacking the safe, in which low-health Brawlers are commonly used in this mode.",
      "InBrawl BallOvertime, if you stun the enemy who is holding the ball with your super, then use Buzz's Reserve Buoy Gadget, grab the ball then shoot it into the goal. All while the enemy is stunned. If you want to do this easier, use Buzz's Star Power Tougher Torpedo."
    ],
    "Recommended Build": [
      "Buzz's Reserve Buoy Gadget is effective for emergency situations such as escaping without having a Super. It can also be used offensively by using it to catch up to enemies faster or by using it as a Super at the beginning of a match.",
      "When playing more open maps against enemies that out-range you, his Eyes Sharp Star Power gives more value as it's easier for Buzz to charge his Super.",
      "Buzz can use his Reserve Buoy gadget to quickly move onto lower health brawlers, as the stun isn't always necessary to finish them."
    ],
    "Strategies": "",
    "Other": [
      "In order to hit all 5 shots, Buzz must either move clockwise around the enemy or attack at point-blank range. The latter, while easier to do, is riskier due to certain Brawlers likeSpike,Bull,Leon,Shelly,Griff,Nani, andDarrylout-matching Buzz in point-blank combat.",
      "Generally, try to auto-aim your Super most of the time unless the enemy is far away from you. His Super is fast, but if there is an enemy moving sideways from a far distance, it is best not to use your Super onto the enemy as they most likely can outrange you.",
      "If an enemy is fleeing and is out of Buzz's range, he can use his Super to quickly catch up to the enemy and stun them, giving him the chance to finish them off.",
      "Buzz isn't immune to damage or when he's traveling to a grappled target, so grappling an enemy when Buzz is on low health is risky. Additionally, if he is stunned, pulled, or knocked back while grappling, his Super is interrupted. However, if other enemies aren't nearby, you can still defeat the grappled enemy as the stun duration is long enough for you to defeat them with Buzz's high damage before the stun wears off.",
      "Since Buzz's Super stuns in a short radius around him once he finishes traveling to the buoy's location, it's better to grapple onto a wall near an enemy rather than grapple the enemy since hitting Buzz's Super on a moving target is difficult. This can ensure that he can at least travel near the enemy's location.",
      "When you face off against another Buzz and both of you super, whoever supers the second gets their stun. Ex: If you stun after your enemy has stunned you, you stun the other Buzz and can defeat him easily.",
      "If a Buzz grapples you to stun, grapple to a nearby wall so the opponent Buzz will be dragged to the wall and the stun will be cancelled.",
      "Buzz's Super allows him to play offensive because his health is above-average and his Super, if grappled from a long distance, can allow him to defeat even tanks like Bull with his Super, which is usually difficult for Brawlers with lower health than tanks. Buzz can simply camp behind walls, inside bushes, or otherwise at a concealed or hard-to-reach location from the enemy and charge his Super in the process, then once he gets his Super, he can grapple onto and defeat enemies.",
      "His Trait charges his Super in 15 seconds with a single enemy inside the radius. If it's the beginning of a match and your Reserve Buoy Gadget isn't enough to secure a defeat due to the absence of the stun, you can simply use obstacles that enemies are hiding behind to passively charge your Super.",
      "Since his Trait still charges his Super on invisible or bush-camping enemies, he can use it as a scouting tool for bush-filled areas or maps likeSnake Prairie. His Eyes Sharp Star Power allows him to better scout enemies because it extends his Trait radius. He can also use his X-Ray Shades gadget for better scouting. However, he is less preferred over better scouting Brawlers such asTara.",
      "If you're facing close-ranged Brawlers in which his Super or Trait aren't necessary, it's best to use his Tougher Torpedo Star Power to extend the stun duration at close range and ensure knocking them out, although it's harder to recharge your Super to escape from other enemies once you've defeated the close-ranged enemies.",
      "Buzz can stun and defeat multiple enemies if they're grouped up with his Super and his wide, high-damaging attack. His slow unload speed makes Buzz vulnerable after his second attack but another Super allows him to defeat them"

      "Byron's Booster Shots Gadget is best used to poison multiple enemies, heal multiple allies, or a combination of the two. It can also be used to heal or poison a single target for more damage/health than a regular shot, and can act as a form of close-range defense in combination with his Super. The Gadget is good for killing low health enemies up close, although sometimes Byron will die too when he uses it up close."
    ],
    "Strategies": [
      "Since his range is long but his cooldown is slow, sharpshooting skills, such as aiming ahead of the enemy's direction of travel, are needed to utilize Byron well. However, with his fast projectile speed, aiming with Byron is easier than with other long-ranged Brawlers such asAmber,Brock,Colt,Mandy, 8-Bit,Belle,Nani,Rico, orBea. Unless there are no enemies near faraway allies, prioritize allies closest to you.",
      "To take advantage of Byron's range is to chip away at enemies with his stacking tick damage while also dodging their fire, and once they're low on health, you can use your Super to finish them off. This strategy will allow Byron to better secure defeats."
    ],
    "Other": [
      "Byron is outstanding at supporting close-ranged Brawlers likeEdgar,Bull,Mortis,Rosa,Lily,Sam,Fang,Buzz,Darryl, orEl Primoas Byron's allies can play aggressively, and if applicable, ambush enemies with their Supers or by bush-camping while Byron can consistently and quickly heal them from a safe distance.",
      "When your attack is auto-aimed, it prioritizes the closest target to you. When fighting alongside a teammate, manually aim to hit the enemy and keep your distance, and even if you have his Injection Star Power, which allows you to chain attacks to hit both allies and enemies, you should still maintain a safe distance away from teammates that is far enough to damage enemies but close enough to heal allies without the disadvantages of long-range aiming.",
      "Byron functions well with8-Bitas 8-Bit's damage booster boosts Byron's damaging abilities. Byron can heal 8-Bit who already has high health, a combination that is very effective inDuo Showdown. The combo is also extremely devastating in game modes where survival is key; the boosted damage from 8-Bit allows Byron to do 1000 damage per poison tick, and the healing rom Byron can help keep 8-Bit alive. Conversely, these two Brawlers in an enemy team should be monitored closely and be approached with caution."

      "Carl's Heat Ejector Gadget can be used to block the path of incoming enemies in events such as Brawl Ball. It can also be paired with his Super to secure a lot of damage to the safe in Heist.",

      "Carl's Flying Hook Gadget is useful for joining to action and retreating in events like Showdown,Gem Grab, andSiege, further helped by allowing him to travel over lakes and rope fences to a certain extent. It is also an excellent tool to counter defenseless Brawlers at close-quarters likePiper, especially if paired with his Super.

      "When Carl's pickaxe returns, it can go through walls and obstacles. This can be crucial when opponents only need one more hit to be defeated but are hiding behind a wall. He can take advantage of this by throwing his pickaxe and moving towards the enemy behind the wall before it returns allowing it to get an indirect hit.",
      "When Carl's pickaxe hits an obstacle, it bounces off and returns, allowing Carl to to throw it again faster. He can utilize this mechanic by pushing enemy Brawlers near a wall. Because his pickaxe will return faster after it hits the wall, Carl can do bursts of damage quickly, especially with his Power Throw Star Power, and he can utilize this to break Power Cube crates inShowdown. This can be highly effective inHeistwhere Carl can utilize walls near the enemy safe to deal consistent and quick damage.",
      "Carl's Flying Hook Gadget can be used withMeepleandFinx's Super; using the Gadget through Meeple's Super area lets him travel through walls (though not stay in them), and using the Gadget through Finx's super makes his movement faster."

    "Other": [
      "Carl's Super does a lot of damage but at a short range. Be sure to get close to an enemy Brawler to maximize its damage, but it is advisable to avoid short-ranged Brawlers who deal damage quicker than Carl can.",
      "When using Carl's Super offensively, make sure to pay attention to his Super's mechanics. Carl's Super doesn't have a shield likeRosa's Super does, making him more likely to get burst down by enemies. However, if he has his Protective Pirouette Star Power, he can partially protect himself during one, though it's still never recommended to go near close-ranged Brawlers likeBull,Darryl,Shelly,Buzz, orEl Primowith his Super to deal damage to them as they all deal great damage at close range, have high health and can use their Supers to interrupt or escape from Carl's Super.",
      "Carl can't use his main attack while using his Super, but he can still use his Super while his pickaxe is still flying.",
      "Keep in mind that the pickaxe's returning ability may pose a disadvantage when attacking while traveling inside bushes. This gives the opponents ample time to perform prediction shots.",
      "Carl's Super makes him have one of the fastest movement speeds in the game. Use this to escape (especially helpful with the Protective Pirouette Star Power as it lets him survive more shots) or to reach low-health enemies.",
      "Carl's Super can be interrupted by knockback, pull, or stun effects such asFrank's,Shelly's,Gene's,Jacky's,Tick's,Buzz's, andCordelius' Super,El Primo's Super or his Suplex Supplement Gadget,Bibi's Home Run attack,Fang's Roundhouse Kick Gadget,Bo's Snare a Bear Star Power, andEmz's Friendzoner Gadget. Avoid using his Super offensively against Brawlers like these who can easily cancel his Super.",

With her Hypercharge, however, she can deal 5000/5600 damage to the heist safe per hit, and since her Hypercharge is able to hit 4 times, she can deal 20000/22400 damage to the safe with one super. She can also recharge her Super if she hits defending enemies along with the safe. Combined with her fast Super charge rate and Mass Tax Star Power, she can repeatedly use her Super on the safe while reducing damage taken so she survives longer. Alternatively, her Push It Star Power is useful as it can push enemies away from the safe while defending, and push defending enemies away when attacking the enemy safe, allowing shorter-ranged Brawlers to offend easier.",
      "She is also very good in Brawl Ball. With her Push It Star Power, she can push enemy brawlers away from the goal, and she can also make them let go of the ball. Along with this, Tank Brawlers like Frank and Bibi are regularly used in that game mode, which are high health targets for her to counter. Colette could also be used in Hot Zone with her Push It Star Power to push enemy Brawlers out of the zone."

      "Colette’s Mass Tax Star Power can make it so that she takes less damage for a good amount of time. However, her Push It Star Power tends to be more useful because of its ability to move Brawlers and guarantee two hits on them. Because of this, Mass Tax is generally used only inHeist, but Push It can also be very useful in that game mode because it can push Brawlers away from the safe and charge Colette’s Hypercharge faster because of the guaranteed two hits. Additionally, her Push It Star Power can also be used to push enemy Brawlers into the gas in game modes likeShowdownorKnockout.",
      "Colette’s Na-Ah! Gadget can be used to finish off Brawlers who are on low health, and would take an additional shot to finish otherwise. Her Gotcha! Gadget tends to be more useful, as 80% of the damage dealt as healing is very good, especially if Colette is fighting against a tanky Brawler who will take a lot of damage from her attacks. Her Na-Ah! Gadget can be used in game modes likeKnockout, while her Gotcha! Gadget can be used in game modes where she is in an open position where many enemy Brawlers will target her, like if she’s holding the ball inBrawl Ballor if she’s near the safe inHeist. Projectiles affected by Colette’s Gotcha! Gadget will do more damage if they hit special targets, letting them do 2400 damage per shot instead of 2000 to non-Brawler targets, likeJessie’s turret or the Heist safe. However, she will not be healed if she hits special targets.",
      "The Damage Gear is good to have in many situations. It can make Colette’s minimum damage of 1000 become 1150, which allows her many more opportunities to defeat Brawlers who are on low health but not low health enough to be defeated in just one shot. The Gadget Gear is also very good to have, as it gives her an additional chance to do more damage to a Brawler or an additional chance to heal herself when she is low on health. The Shield Gear can also be good, as it prevents the two shot and super combo from happening to you from other Colettes."

      "Colette is a Brawler that specializes in countering tanks. Her attacks can deal massive amounts of damage to them, but without proper support and understanding of her abilities, she struggles to take enemies out in a short amount of time. Therefore, she synergizes with assassins like Crow,Buzz,Fang, or Leon as she can quickly bring enemies to low health and allow the assassins to finish them off.",
      "Use walls and other obstacles to your advantage when using Colette's Super. Even without her Push It Star Power, Colette can still hit an enemy twice quickly if they are close to a wall while using her Super.",
      "If she hits two normal attacks and a Super, Colette can defeat every Brawler in the game provided that they do not have any shields or passive healing abilities. Her Super has a quick charging rate along with her attack, so she can do this multiple times. This can be aided with her Mass Tax Star Power, which protects her as she supers.",
      "Colette's Super can be used to collect gems and return to cover, making her a good last-resort gem carrier inGem Grabif your primary gem carrier is suddenly defeated. Her Super can also be used to collect Power Cubes inShowdownor Bolts inSiege.",
      "Beware of using your Super against Brawlers with high burst damage likeBull,Edgar,Griff,Leon,Shelly,Darryl, Buzz,El Primo,Nani,Emz, Colt,8-Bit, orSpikesince they can easily defeat you when you rush into them, so make sure to have exhausted their ammo before using your Super on them. With her Push It Star Power, however, you can briefly immobilize high-burst Brawlers while using your Super as well as finish them off when they are on sufficiently low health with two hits, so Push It is a safe way to use Colette's Super effectively against such Brawlers.",
      "Colette with her Super is capable of defeating the entire enemy team. Her Super's large width can hit multiple enemies, and if she hits two Brawlers both when dashing forward and dashing back, she immediately charges another Super, effectively allowing her to use her Super again for massive amounts of damage.",
      "Be very careful when using Colette's Push It Star Power. When used against Brawlers that can outrange her, it may push them out of range of her main attack, which would give them an advantage against her. In this situations, it is recommended not to use this Star Power when facing these Brawlers.",
      "When using Colette in Showdown, keep chipping off at enemies' health at a distance until you can use your Super or Na-ah Gadget to finish them off. Be mindful about how the enemy can counter your two shots and Super combo, such as shields, healing, or damage debuffs.",
      "Colette also has excellent synergy withByronin Heist, as Colette can continuously get healed by Byron's attacks and Super while she repeatedly dashes into the safe with her own Super. This is even more effective if Colette uses her Mass Tax Star Power.",
      "One thing that makes Colette's upgrade different from that of other Brawlers is that the Damage percentage remains the same at 37% of opponents' current Health (though the minimum Damage changes). This means that Colette's Damage output is not as level-dependent compared to other Brawlers."

      "Colt does best on open maps, where he can easily control the map, out-ranging close-ranged Brawlers with his attacks and Super. In addition to Colt's effectiveness on open maps, his Magnum Special Star Power increases his effectiveness on these maps as it grants him additional range and therefore increases his area of control.

In contrast, the Silver Bullet Gadget not only clears obstacles but also ensures a guaranteed hit in close-quarters combat, allowing for effective ambush tactics and surprise attacks on opponents. Therefore, if you can hit most shots consistently—particularly in tightly confined maps or against stationary or slow-moving targets—Speedloader may be the superior choice, as it enables you to inflict considerably more damage with its two full ammo supplies compared to Silver Bullet's single shot.",

      "When being attacked byMortis, try to keep moving to one direction and shooting to the exact opposite way Colt is facing. Because Mortis lands slightly behind or in Colt with his attack, he has to follow him with subsequent attacks if Colt keeps moving the same way, making Mortis run into all of the bullets.",
      "Take advantage of his high burst damage. When you're up against enemies with low health or squishy Brawlers, a quick burst of shots can take them out before they can even get close. Colt's basic attack reloads fairly quickly, so with precise aiming and positioning, you can deal significant damage in short bursts."

      "Crow is niche in offense-oriented modes such asShowdown, and his effectiveness in these modes is amplified with his Star Powers. Since surviving while defeating the enemies is the top priority in these modes, Extra Toxic reducing an enemy's damage is a viable tactic. Since Extra Toxic's effect is percentage-based, it also scales with a target's damage, making him better against heavyweights or enemies with a high amount of Power Cubes. Meanwhile, Carrion Crow can be very strong in 1v1 interactions. Early into the game where Power Cubes aren't abundant, Carrion Crow can provide crucial damage required to eliminate an enemy early. The Star Power of choice ultimately depends on play style: Extra Toxic is better for a sustained, controlled game of Showdown while Carrion Crow is better for an aggressive play style that capitalizes on early eliminations.",
      "Although Crow is able to bring down enemies' health frequently with his attacks and poison, his low health and damage output makes him ineffective in close-mid range encounters with assassins and tanks without his super or gadget. He also struggles against long-range Brawlers likeBrock,Piper,Colt,Mandy,8-Bit,Rico,Amber,Bea, andNanion open maps, due to their high damage output and superior range. This makes Crow efficient in mid-range control and assassination, as well as providing vision to enemies hiding in bushes for his team with his poison. He also counters healers since his poison weakens the efficiency of their healing."

    "Recommended Build": [
      "Crow's Extra Toxic Star Power reduces damage dealt by poisoned enemies. This also works on IKE turrets,Boss FightRobots, andBig GameBosses, making them overall less effective in the long run, and increasing his team's survivability.",
      "Crow's Carrion Crow Star Power allows Crow to pick off low-health enemies with ease. Allow your allies to bring an enemy to half health, then poke them down until they're defeated, and the damage boost should allow this to be done quicker than usual.",
      "Crow's Defense Booster Gadget should be activated after using Crow's Super to get more value and to be able to play aggressively. His Slowing Toxin Gadget, however, should be activated right before using Crow's Super to block mobility to escape from Crow's Super."
    ],
    "Strategies": [
      "Due to Crow's fast reload speed and fast unload speed, he can unload his attack relatively frequently. This allows him to constantly apply poison and regular damage on enemies, preventing them from healing and charging up his Super all the while.",
      "Crow's Super is a fitting assassination tool. Once a Brawler is on low health because of the poison, he can jump on them for a quick defeat. Because the daggers fly out around him, you should position yourself to land onto an enemy, which maximizes the Super's potential. Crow's Super also is a viable escape tool. If he is low on health with enemies approaching, you can use his Super to fly away and escape while also damaging the enemies. His Defense Booster Gadget enables better survivability while using his Super, and his Slowing Toxin Gadget also prevents enemies from chasing Crow or retreating from Crow's Super. This works best with close-ranged Brawlers, as they'll be poisoned and can't reach him to attack him due to Crow's relatively long range. Due to this, Crow excels in modes likeTakedown,KnockoutandDuo Showdown.",
      "Crow's poison prevents the poisoned Brawler from self-healing for 4 seconds more than the normal healing time (3 seconds), raising the required time for auto-regeneration to be 7 seconds instead (similar toEl Primo's El Fuego Star Power) since the poison enables damage for an extended period. This exponentially hinders an enemy's ability to regroup with allies and/or recover health. The poison also reveals the enemy when they are inside bushes, so it also prevents enemies inflicted with poison from hiding and healing. For this reason, Crow is a great poker that can finish off low-health enemies or continuously prevent isolated Brawler from healing and force them to retreat.",
      "To use Crow is to take advantage of his range by poking at the enemy. Attack from a distance and back off to chip away at an enemy's health and charge his Super. While poking, use Crow's fast movement speed to dodge enemy fire. Although poking deals moderate damage each time, especially because other Brawlers are more effective in long-ranged combat than Crow, poking will slowly defeat the enemy and hinder any healing.",
      "Crow's Super can be useful forBrawl Ball. When Crow has the ball and his Super, he can self-pass by kicking the ball in front of him, and then use his Super to jump past other Brawlers and retrieve the ball, and then attempt to score.",
      "Whenever playing him onShowdownwith theAngry RoboModifier, it's not recommended to play solo as Crow can't deal high damage to the Boss by himself; playingDuo Showdownwith a high-damaging teammate is much more ideal.",
      "An advanced aiming tactic is to hit 2 daggers at medium range from an enemy by aiming slightly to the edges. This gets easier the closer an enemy is to him. However, at a certain point, it's simply better to quickfire so all 3 daggers hit a target.",
      "Keep in mind how many daggers and/or poison damage Crow requires for his Super. Knowing this can help you decide when to jump to eliminate an enemy and whether you should continue pursuing them as your target.",
      "Crow is highly vulnerable to assassins with high mobility, such asMortis,Mico,Buzz,Stu,Cordelius, andEdgar, at close range without his Super or help from allies. In these scenarios, it's best to group with them. Attack them at a range, and when they get close, quickly group with a teammate with high damage at close range, such asShelly,Bull, Fang,Leon,Spike,Griff, El Primo, Buzz,Doug, andDarryl, who could potentially protect him and potentially defeat the enemy.",
      "A good strategy in Showdown is to play as a third-party (waiting for a fight to end, defeating the winner, and stealing all of the Power Cubes). You can ramp up Cubes quickly with this strategy. As Crow, you should keep enemies who are on low health after a fight poisoned continuously until they are defeated, since Crow is incapable of dealing high damage immediately.",
      "Before using his Slowing Toxin Gadget in 3v3s, make sure that more than 1 target is currently poisoned. For the best use, poison all the three enemies and then use the Gadget to slow all the enemies to make way for teamwipes.",
      "An effective strategy is to pair with a Brawler likeColette,Surge, Spike,Fang,Emz,Nani, Stu, Bea,Penny, Brock, Colt, or Piper (at a range) who can bring an enemy down to low health very quickly, and then use his poison and Super to eliminate them without risk of getting defeated.

    "Game Modes and Maps": [
      "Draco is a menace in game modes that require lane control, especiallyHot ZoneandBrawl Ball. In Hot Zone, Draco's high hit points and Gadget allows him to withstand a considerable amount of damage, and with his Super, he is able to either force enemies out of the zone or prevent them from moving in a specific lane. In Brawl Ball, Draco is able to pressure the enemies with his Super and deal a substantial amount of damage at mid-close range. However, mind that Draco struggles against long-range Brawlers unless he is in close range. This means he is usually not a top-pick in an open map."
    ],
    "Recommended Build": [
      "Because Draco's Uppercut Gadget has a short enough knockback range that it can actually pose as a disadvantage for you and your teammates because enemies cannot be hit midair. Instead, Draco should use this Gadget as a way of escaping if he is in danger.",
      "Draco's Last Stand should be activated when Draco is still at medium health, therefore he can rush in, activate the Gadget, and deal a lot of damage to the enemy team. Unfortunately, he will probably end up being quickly defeated once the Gadget duration ends. He can also activate this Gadget and act as a meat shield for his allies to take control of key points on the map.",
      "Because his Expose Star Power lasts for five seconds and takes five seconds to recharge, he can consistently apply 35% extra damage to the same enemy without it ever wearing off until the enemy or Draco is defeated.",
      "Draco's Shredding Star Power will still give him the healing even if he activates his Super while his Super is already active. This can give Draco an overall larger amount of tanking."
    ],
    "Strategies": [
      "Because of Draco's unique attack mechanic, it's recommended to use him to check for enemies in bushes first, dealing high damage at his range's apex before slowly hounding them down and charging up his Super."

      "InGem GraborSiege, throwing an attack near a Gem/Bolt can drive enemies away from it, therefore allowing Dynamike or his teammates to retrieve the item more easily and preventing enemies from retrieving it. The same strategy works with Tick.",
      "InShowdown, if your enemy is near the gas, you can throw your Big Barrel o' Boom to knock them into the gas for them to take extra damage. The Super already deals massive damage, and when with coupled with the gas, it can secure a defeat against low-medium health enemies. Your Demolition Star Power amplifies this strategy's effectiveness."

      "His Fidget Spinner Gadget is useful for checking bushes because it covers an extremely wide area. He can also use his Gadget to reliably defeat low-health enemies who are very close to him, which would be otherwise very hard to hit with his main attack. His Fidget Spinner Gadget is also useful inHeistdue to the large amount of dynamite it fires, so make sure you move slightly clockwise to maximize its damage.",
      "Dynamike's attack fuse makes it hard for him to defend. His Satchel Charge Gadget allows him to burst enemies down safely, especially low-health ones. This is also incredibly useful in Heist when attempting to take out heavyweights. His reliance on this Gadget makes it more niche in offense-oriented modes such asBounty, where stuns are valuable tools to have.",
      "Dynamike's Dyna-Jump Star Power takes many hours to master but is very rewarding. This Star Power will reduce or eliminate his counters' abilities to counter him. An effective strategy with this is Dyna-Jumping and right before it takes effect, throw a Satchel Charge attack at your enemies to trick them and easily defeat them.",
      "A moderately difficult but useful strategy is double-jumping with his Dyna-Jump. To do this, throw a shot at your feet and then quickly throw another shot parallel and 1-2 tiles away from the first shot. The first shot will propel you forward and if your timing and position are right, it'll propel you towards the second shot for that shot to propel you. It's much trickier with his Super as you'll have to throw an attack further. Double-jumping will take a lot of practice to master, but it can assist you in many situations and if you master it, you can even triple-jump or quad-jump and avoid getting hit for the while that you're jumping. Though the timing is tricky, it's possible to jump over enemy attacks with Dynamike's Dyna-Jump Star Power. This is rare, but can help in sticky situations when under heavy fire.",
      "His Dyna-Jump Star Power is effective to escape from danger by throwing dynamite at your feet. This not only damages nearby enemies, but also throws you far enough away from enemies to avoid damage, and allows for a speedy escape over walls. In desperate situations, his Super propels him even further, making it a more reliable tool for escape while also being able to damage and even defeat enemies due to the large amounts of damage dealt by the Super or attack. He can also utilize it to boost him towards vital areas or items such as the zones inHot Zone.",
      "Dynamike's Demolition Star Power can be used to fool enemies when they head into enclosed areas that you're in. This especially works withEdgar,Mico,Leon,Crow, orSurgeas they don't have wall-breaking abilities, making them unable to escape from his Super.",
      "Dynamike's Satchel Charge Gadget and Demolition Star Power is a good build for Dynamike. In certain situations, Dynamike can stun enemies and then throw his Super at them. Due to the stun, the enemy won't be able to dodge the Super as people often do nor can they provide counter fire. Demolition deals a lot of damage to the enemy and, coupled with the attack, it'll incinerate out medium-to lower-health Brawlers. For tanks, throw more attacks with the Super to knock them out while they're stunned. Though not necessary, Demolition, if available, should definitely be used because it aids in taking out or heavily damaging Brawlers, especially tanks."
    ],
    "Strategies": [
      "A difficult but rewarding tactic with Dynamike is where you aim Dynamike's Super and quickly toss a main attack in such a way that Super can push enemies into the sticks of dynamite. This deals extreme amounts of damage to them and usually eliminates them unless they're heavyweights likeFrank,Bull,Darryl, orEl Primo. If the enemy had enough health and the sticks of dynamite were perfectly placed, Dynamike also instantly recharges his Super, in which he can chain Supers.",
      "Assassins are huge counters to Dynamike due to their above-average speeds and traveling abilities, which help him escape Dynamike's delayed shots, so watch out for them before they can burst you down. Alternatively, if caught by them, you can use Satchel Charge to possibly change the fate of the fight, though this only works if you land the shot correctly or specifically forMortiswaste his ammo so it's easier to land the shot. You can also use your Fidget Spinner Gadget's speed boost to escape before they get too close to you, but it isn't very useful when they've already reached you because of again, assassins' traveling abilities and fast movement speed.",
      "If a close-range Brawler is chasing you, throw your dynamites a little ahead of you. This can stop them from following or deal damage. With his Dyna-Jump Star Power, you can also surprise enemies and increase your chances of escaping.",
      "Hiding behind a wall within a bush in front of it and throwing the dynamite towards the enemy from there can be effective since it's difficult for most other Brawlers to reach you, and they'll be caught by surprise due to you being hidden. This also means that his Satchel Charge Gadget, if activated, will be more likely to hit, which can be devastating towards an opponent and enable Dynamike to easily decimate them.",
      "Dynamike's dynamites can deal massive damage if thrown correctly. Since the dynamite has a delay before blowing up, try predicting the enemy's movement and throwing it where the enemy is likely to be by the time the dynamite detonates. Auto-aiming almost guarantees a miss against moving enemies, but if in a pinch, auto-aiming is more reliable when enemies are farther away. You may also want to throw two pairs of dynamites in succession in two different areas as it's more likely that at least one will hit and still deal a decent amount of damage.",
      "If there's aMeepleon your team, have them use their Mansions of Meeple Gadget so you can throw dynamite into the dice towers, blowing up enemies from a safe distance. However, Dynamike's Super will destroy the towers, so refrain from using it unless the walls are about to expire or the enemies will be defeated by it."
    ],
    "Other": [
      "Try throwing your Super to damage at least two enemies, because as it deals enough damage to charge another Super, allowing you to chain Supers and deal plethoras of damage.",
      "The spread between Dynamike's dynamites decreases as he throws the sticks closer to himself, making it significantly harder to hit enemies close to him. However, he can also use this to his advantage as such enemies are more likely to be hit by both dynamites and will take more damage."

      "Edgar is not often recommended inBountysince long-ranged Brawlers dominate the mode and his short range makes him disadvantageous. If playing him in Bounty, focus on pressuring enemies in the back of the map, and perform hit-and-run attacks using your Super. However, don't play him in open Bounty maps likePurple Paradiseas he's more vulnerable to longer-ranged Brawlers.",
      "Though he has low health and short range, Edgar is decent inSuper City Rampageand his viability is amplified with his Fisticuffs Star Power. He can stall the Boss for a long while, dealing a plethora of damage to it while also healing in the process. Edgar pairs best with healers like Byron in this mode as they can boost his healing and allow him to bring the Boss to low health without dying, even allowing him to defeat it.",
      "InBoss Fight, Edgar can utilize his mechanics (his sheer burst damage/healing and great mobility) to provide nearly-unparalleled offense/defense. In this mode, he's best used as the Power Cube carrier since it grants him more survivability along with his healing and amplifies his already high damage. His Fisticuffs Star Power is more effective in this mode since he can dive into swarms of bots and heal more effectively than he already would and overall survive longer whereas Hard Landing, even with the additional damage it dishes out, it's still insufficient against higher-health entities.Aside from Power Cubes and Fisticuffs, additional buffs will also benefit Edgar; 8-Bit,Ruffs, Pam, andMaxall amplify Edgar's effectiveness in Boss Fight.",

      "His speed boost after his Super can also be utilized well inGem GraborSiegeas he can jump onto the Gem mine or into the Bolt spawns, which then he can steal Gems or Bolts and quickly retreat. He can also use this to escape more effectively when he's in danger.However, his low health and lack of range diminish his viability in the above modes due to his inability to deal with long-ranged enemies with control abilities that are versatile in the above modes.

      "Edgar is an incredibly great ambusher and camper in offense-oriented modes likeShowdown. Though he has low health, he heals each time he lands a successful punch, and his reload and unload speed are extremely fast. When playing Edgar, it's best to use him in enclosed maps such asCavern Churn, in which these are what he dominates in. InDuo Showdown, he can be paired up with healers likeByron, similarly to with tanks and other assassins to increase the chances of victory.",
      "Edgar is an outstanding choice in speed-based modes likeBrawl Ballbecause of his very fast movement speed and great mobility. He can kick the ball/trophy ahead of him and then use his Super to jump to the ball/trophy and grab it again (self-passing), similarly toEl Primo. After self-passing, he can then quickly shoot the ball/trophy into the designated area. Edgar is also aided by the speed boost that he gains after his Super. Keep in mind that Edgar has low health so be careful while performing this."

Since they have the disadvantage of little to no ammo, Edgar can attack them with ease without taking much damage. Even if he takes damage when the enemy reloads, his attack heals him and offsets the enemy's previous damage, allowing him to secure a defeat. His Hardcore Gadget allows him to survive longer if he takes more damage.",
      "Edgar vs. Edgar matchups are quite common in Showdown due to Edgar's viability in the game mode. Since Edgar can heal from punches and displace others with his Super, the outcome of an Edgar vs. Edgar fight is usually unpredictable. However, there are some tactics you can perform to typically guarantee yourself a victory (unless the opposing Edgar does the same or has an advantage that you don't).The first tactic is to run away from the enemy while attacking to \"extend\" your attack's range. Due to Edgar's quick unload speed and reload speed, the enemy will be low on health, if not dead, before realizing their mistake. Conversely, when facing another Edgar performing this tactic, use your Super to jump ahead of the enemy (if the opposing Edgar doesn't have their Super) or retreat (allowing you to use the same strategy in case the enemy Edgar follows you).The second tactic is to auto-aim your Super in the middle of the fight to avoid a few punches. In an Edgar vs Edgar matchup, every ammo counts and therefore avoiding a few punches gives you an advantage. If the Edgar uses this strategy against you, either use your Super to escape or perform the first tactic. Also, if you are low on health, never use your Super before the enemy Edgar. Once you Super, you have no means of escape and he can simply jump on you and defeat you.",

Because of that, it's better to focus on other targets, specifically weaker ones like throwers and sharpshooters.His healing however, along with his Fisticuffs Star Power (if you have it equipped), greatly help him take on tanks.

It's also niche to bush-camp and wait for an enemy to head near the bush, and then quickly exit the bush and attack them.",
      "If fighting against Frank, it's recommended to attack and use Edgar's speed to your advantage. Each time Frank attacks, there's a delay, where Edgar can move behind Frank and deal damage while taking none and healing. You may also use your Super to evade Frank's devastating Super, therefore wasting it. Attacking works better with his Fisticuffs Star Power because of the boosted healing.",
      "Brawlers with slow unload speeds like Pam and 8-Bit can be defeated by Edgar at close-quarters combat despite their high health since Edgar can unload all his attacks much quicker than them and heal himself in the process. Due to their slow unload and Edgar's speed boost after his Super, Edgar can strafe away from the majority of the fire. However, note that if Edgar incorrectly strafes, he might take the attack's full damage, dealing immense damage to him if not defeating him. Because of this, it's necessary to analyze all of your options and the enemy's before committing a jump on them.",

      "El Primo has a great synergy with healers likePoco,Byron,Pam,Doug, orBerry, so while he’s hit by an enemy and receiving Super charge, his teammate can heal him. Once he charges his Super, he can use it on an enemy, significantly damage or eliminate the enemy, and repeat the process. A similar strategy is to useRuffs' Field Promotion Star Power to increase El Primo’s maximum health and allow El Primo to withstand more damage while charging his Super, but this strategy is time-consuming and if El Primo dies, his health resets.",
      "You can try a strategy in bush maps in which you keep spamming your Suplex Supplement Gadget near bushes, and once an enemy comes near you, your Suplex Supplement Gadget will activate and throw the enemy back, surprising them in the process and giving you ample time to take advantage of this. Using this to determine their position and the Brawler being used, you can then plan your next move (attacking them or retreating). This especially works in Showdown (in maps likeDark Passage,NruhC nrevaC, andCavern Churn).",
      "The asteroid from El Primo's Asteroid Belt Gadget attacks the Brawler closest to him. While enemies try to dodge the asteroid, their movement can be predictable, making them easy targets for him or his allies. It can also be used to hit an enemy taking cover behind obstacles, which opens up enemy cover. Keep in mind that an teammate of yours or El Primo himself might need specific obstacles to properly function regularly or on a certain map.",
      "When his Super is used at close range, El Primo immediately hits the ground. This can be used to quickly cancelFrankorCarl's Supers, effectively incapacitating the opponent. While his Suplex Supplement Gadget is probably more useful in such situations, his Super has a variable range and can also weaken them further, allowing his Super to be a good alternative when the moment is right."
    ],
    "Other": [
      "El Primo can deal high damage but his main attack has one of the shortest ranges in the game. To attack long-ranged Brawlers, players must attempt to maneuver El Primo into range and dodge enemy fire. However, El Primo's Super allows him to travel a long distance, making it effective to get closer to enemies and attack them. Because of this, you can justify this strategy with your Trait. First, charge your Super with El Primo’s Trait by allowing the enemy to attack you, then once your Super is charged up, you can jump onto them and defeat them. Regardless of these tactics, El Primo almost always struggles without the presence or strategic use of walls.",
      "Take caution when facingBull, as with a normal interaction, Bull can defeat El Primo due to his superior damage, unload speed and range. You should try to attack Bull with the tip of El Primo's range; avoid getting too close or staying too far. Bull, when all his shells hit, can three-shot an El Primo of the same Power Level, so avoiding some of his shells should secure a victory against him. El Primo can also use his Super to knock Bull back and maintain some distance, which allows El Primo to better secure a victory against Bull.",
      "Because his projectile speed is slower compared to other short-ranged Brawlers, a good way to defeat him with other short-ranged Brawlers is to walk around him in a circle. This can ensure that only one or two of El Primo's punches per ammo are going to hit and will prolong the life of the short-ranged Brawler."

      "Emz is better in open maps with ample space, so you should play her in maps likeMassive AttackorSkull Creek, where her Super can maintain area control and her attack has an advantage in the moderately spaced field.",
      "Emz is a great control Brawler inGem Grab,Brawl Balland especiallyHot Zonedue to her lingering attack. Use Emz to push your enemies to the opposing side while consistently collect gems in Gem Grab, keep enemies slowed down when they’re carrying the Ball in Brawl Ball or cover an area of the zone for a long time in Hot Zone.",
      "Emz can deal insane amounts of damage inHeistwith Quickfire modifier, as every tick of damage from her lingering attack will add to her ammo. Once Emz gets in range, as long as she isn't defeated immediately, she can release her attacks in rapid succession, with each ammo adding to the other. Combined with her Bad Karma Star Power, Hypercharge, and Damage Gear, she can destroy the safe in about twenty seconds. If you see the opposing team with an Emz, be sure to keep her away from your team's safe at all time, as the game will end very quickly otherwise (unless you have a clear advantage)."

      "Friendzoner is very effective for keeping distance and protecting Emz from assassins and close-ranged Brawlers likeEdgar,Mortis,Sam,Fang,Rosa,Shade, orLily. When they get in range, use the Gadget to distance yourself and quickly fire your shots. As Emz can deal most damage with the mid of her attack, this combo can usually kill the said enemy. Plus, by releasing your shot and then immediately using Friendzoner, you can push the enemy into the fray of your attacks and deal an extra tick of damage (4 instead of 3).",
      "Emz's second Star Power, Hype, can heal her significantly when multiple enemies are in her Super's range. This gives her much less pressure when fighting back, and as the enemies are slowed with her Super's area-of-effect, she is able to hit her shots easier and take down enemies in no time. This gives her a clear advantage in modes likeBrawl BallorGem Grab, where survivability and area control is the key to winning."

    "Strategies": [
      "Similar toGeneusing his Lamp Blowout Gadget to score in Brawl Ball, you can also try this strategy by scoring with your Friendzoner Gadget. Firstly, get directly close to the enemy goal’s side walls, which should have enemy defenders blocking the goal. If you have the Ball, immediately kick it towards the nearest enemy, because the enemy should be carrying it in order for this to work. Then, use your Friendzoner Gadget to push the enemy back, which knocks the Ball out of their grasp, and if you’re near the side wall, it’ll push the Ball into the goal unless an enemy is inside the goal to circumvent this strategy and block the Ball.",
      "Despite its small range and radius, Emz's Friendzoner Gadget can be used to either knock the Ball out of a Brawler's grasp in Brawl Ball, cancelFrank's,Carl’s, orMeg's Super(s) or, inShowdown, push enemies into the poison gas if positioned accurately.",
      "Perhaps the largest weakness Emz has is that she cannot deal sufficient damage if a Brawler is close to her. Her Friendzoner Gadget covers this weakness. If an enemy Brawler is in close-quarters with you, you can use it to push them back. However, it’s less useful against Brawlers with Supers that allow them to move such as Bull as they can re-approach you.",
      "Emz can fire an attack at an enemy close to her and then use her Friendzoner Gadget immediately afterwards to push the enemy into the lingering area of her attack. While it requires very precise timing, this can cause enemies to take one extra tick of damage, which is beneficial in defeating enemies faster.",
      "When using Emz's Super, try to position so that the enemy is near the edge of your Super range. This way, when you attack, the enemy will be slowed and forced to suffer from all 3 ticks of your attack.",
      "Emz can deal the most damage in mid-long range so don't approach close-ranged Brawlers where they would have an advantage over you. InBibi's case, however, you can use her knockback against her, which is opportunistic provided that you survived Bibi's knockback attack, and then you can spam your lingering spray, which will force Bibi to retreat or be eliminated."
    ],
    "Other": [
      "Emz can perform guerrilla tactics that both consist of firing hairspray and running for cover in quick succession because of her attack’s lingering. However, unlike her Super, her main attacks don’t go through walls and open space is required for these tactics to work.",
      "When using her Super, try to damage enemies behind walls so that you can damage them while they're unable to do so. This strategy, however, can circumvent when facing throwers such asBarley,Dynamike,Sprout,Grom, orTickwho can still attack you regardless of walls in the way.",
      "As another Brawler, if Emz is chasing you, running away will allow you to outrange her attack due to its slow travel time, however, getting closer to her, especially when she is low on ammo, will allow you to defeat her easily.. One good example is Mortis, if you know how to dash, you can easily approach Emz without taking too much damage and quickly take her down. Be warned that experienced players will save their Super and Friendzoner Gadget to counter this tactic, therefore more caution is needed when using other Brawlers to get close to Emz.",
      "Emz is very effective at mid-long range. Try to keep the enemy you are attacking at about 2/3 of the attack range, as this causes the enemy to take the full amount of 3 ticks of damage. However, if the enemy is in very close proximity to you, you’ll only be able to deal 1 tick of damage, and if the enemy is at the far range of your attack, it’ll only do two. This makes Emz very vulnerable to close-ranged Brawlers who get close enough to her, especially airborne Brawlers likeEl Primo, Edgar, andMico, and this requires her to use her Friendzoner Gadget to distance her from such Brawlers.",
      "Emz can be useful when chasing down low-health Brawlers since her lingering attack can stack up to massive amounts of damage and her Super can slow down Brawlers who are escaping. This attribute is beneficial during desperate situations inBounty, Brawl ball, Hot zone or Gem Grab.",
      "Emz's attack speed is fast enough for her to fire another hairspray cloud before her previous attack has fully dissipated. The damage from both attacks stack on top of each other, effectively doubling her damage per tick. However, she reloads slowly, so try not to waste shots in the excitement of dealing high burst damage.",
      "Try to avoid engagingBuzz, as he’s a major counter to Emz. His Super can stun Emz and pull him towards her, allowing Buzz to easily eliminate her, and despite his short range, his Trait enables him to charge his Super passively, which allows him to play passive around obstacles to charge his Super. If you’re facing Buzz and have Emz's Friendzoner Gadget, you can carefully time when Buzz uses his Super, and if he does end up latching onto you, push him away once he's moderately close to you, cancelling his Super and knocking him back into your attack's range."

      "Gale's support abilities truly shine in events like Gem Grab andBountywhere he should use his Super to protect the Gem or Star carrier from approaching enemy tanks and other high-damaging enemies by pushing them back a considerable distance. He may also push enemies away from the Gem mine, allow for control of it and collecting Gems at ease.",
      "Gale is also useful forHeistand Siege. One of the best ways to use Gale's Spring Ejector Gadget in these events is to position the launch pad in such a way that when Gale and fellow Brawlers use it, they are able to reach the other team's safe or IKE. Make sure to change the position of the launch pad every so often in order to make it more unpredictable as to where allies will land. In addition, if Gale is the protector of his and team’s safe or IKE, he can push enemies away from his and his team’s safe or IKE in a direction that the enemies will be far from their safe or IKE as well, buying more time for his teammates to defeat the enemies’ safe or IKE; He can also push enemies away from the Bolts, or slow them down from receiving Bolts with the Freezing Snow Star Power.",
      "Gale can be a great asset to any Brawl Ball/Basket Brawl/Trophy Thievesteam, as his Spring Ejector Gadget can help get his teammates back into action by placing it at the foot of his goal or trophy area, and his Super can knock the Ball or trophy out of a carrier's grasp, while blowing them away from the ball or trophy. Gale's Super also affects the landing position of the respective item if it’s being carried which allows him to potentially score goals within 3 tiles away from the enemy goal or shoot the trophy into the trophy area.",
      "Gale is an outstanding control Brawler for Hot Zone. His Super pushes enemy Brawlers back, giving time for teammates to heal up and for allies to deal damage. This allows for more capturing of the zones while the enemies have to make their way back. This is most useful in maps where there is a single hot zone in the center (i.e.Dueling BeetlesandRing of Fire). Gale’s Spring Ejector Gadget is also a valuable help, as the launch pad can allow allies to reach zones quicker and providing a solid defense in the zone.",
      "Gale is not a bad choice inBoss FightandSuper City Rampagesince the Boss's and the Monster's hitboxes are larger than normal, so all 6 snowballs from Gale's attack will hit, dealing more damage than usual. At maximum level, his snowballs can deal up to 2352 damage, and he can deal damage consistently. His Super is also useful to cancel out the Boss's or Monster's special attacks, especially with his Blustery Blow Star Power so you can stun them, or to distance yourself from them when they are using their melee attacks on you or chasing you when both teammates are dead. You can also use his Freezing Snow Star Power on the Mega Monster to buy time to defeat it.",
      "Gale is a decent choice inBig Gamebecause as the Big Boss, he can push enemies away from him, and with his Blustery Blow Star Power, he can stun the Hunters, though Blustery Blow is only effective when he is the Big Boss, as stuns are ineffective against the Big Boss. As a Hunter, he can place his Spring Ejector Gadget to allow close-ranged Hunters to circumvent obstacles or allow other Hunters to get back into action faster after being defeated, and he can slow the Big Boss with his Freezing Snow Star Power. Since the Big Boss has an extremely large hitbox, all of the snowballs will hit, dealing massive damage. If long-ranged Brawlers are on his team, he can push the Big Boss far, allowing them to deal massive damage."
    ],
    "Recommended Build": [
      "Gale with his Freezing Snow Star Power can limit enemy's strafing abilities and also force groups of Brawlers to group up to defeat Gale together by slowing them down, thus allowing splash-damage teammates or allies with piercing mechanics to easily perform a team-wipe.",
      "Note that Gale's Twister Gadget only hinders enemy movement, not enemy attacks, so stay an ample distance away from it to avoid heavy, long-ranged fire. Gale's Twister Gadget can also make enemy Brawlers go over walls."
    ],
    "Strategies": [],
    "Other": [
      "A maximum of 4 snowballs hit targets with normal-sized hitboxes like Brawlers and the Heist safe at a relatively close range unless the target moves considerably, as the snowballs don’t originate from the center of the attack.",
      "Gale's Super allows him to displace enemies into his favor, depending on the situation. He can either push them away from him and his team to save him and them (especially from close-ranged attacks) or push the enemy team into his, allowing for allied close-ranged Brawlers to deal more damage.",
      "Be careful when facingEmzorPiperas they deal more damage the further away their target is. In some situations, using Gale’s Super on them inadvertently allows them to deal massive damage to you, so it’s better to push them when behind walls, into walls with his Blustery Blow Star Power, or into other enemies or into the poison clouds in Showdown. However, if Gale is near them, he should quickly eliminate them and ignore a charged Super, because both the Brawlers deal mediocre damage at close range and won't be a match for Gale.",
      "A combination of Gale's Super with his Blustery Blow Star Power and three main attacks (assuming that four projectiles hit per attack) can guarantee defeat to an enemy with 7920 or less health.",
      "When vulnerable enemies are hiding behind a one or two tile thick wall, Gale can use his Super to push them away from them the wall and then defeat them."

      "The effectiveness of Gene's Super can be amplified when used inEventswithModifiersactive. It can be used to pull enemies into the area where meteors are going to land, pull them into robots, or pull them away from energy drinks and healing mushrooms. His Super can also be used to pull enemies into the poison gas.",
      "When using Gene's Super, be aware of who your target is. Avoid using it on close-medium ranged Brawlers or a Brawler with a dangerous Super charged, likeClancy,Hank,Shelly,Dynamike,Pearl,Maisie, or Carl (if he uses his Super after you pull him with yours), and inShowdown, an enemy with a large amount of Power Cubes; doing so in these situations will most likely result in backfire. If you do accidentally use your Super on the above Brawlers, make sure to use your Lamp Blowout Gadget to push them back, giving you ample time and distance to attack or escape from them.",
      "Gene's pull has priority over every entity in the game, except against another Gene that is pulling someone, the knockback from his Lamp Blowout Gadget, and the knockback from Gus' Super. This means Gene can pull enemies into minecarts inMinecart Madnessto deal 2000 damage to them. Gene can also make use of his Gadget Lamp Blowout to push enemies into the minecarts.",
      "Since Gene's attack has a very wide spread angle, it is very effective at checking bushes. His attack is also effective at dealing small chip damage that prevents enemies from healing from a long range, similar toCrow's andAngelo's poison.",
      "Gene is especially powerful when paired withMax, as Gene can heal Max with his Magic Puffs Star Power while she provides consistent damage, and Max's speed boost from her Super allows Gene to consistently land his Supers. This combination is also extremely deadly in 3v3 modes.",
      "Gene’s Super will always hit an enemy if you auto-aim at close range. But be careful—you might pull the wrong target. Aim manually if you want to hit a specific enemy or if you’re pulling from far away."

      "Due to Jacky's short range, she isn't ideal for extremely open maps such asPurple Paradisein Bounty, where long-ranged Brawlers will outrange her and fend Jacky off. If playing Jacky on an open map, use her Hardy Hard Hat Star Power because she can rush enemies and dodge their shots, and she can withstand more damage. Her Counter Crush Star Power is less useful since its range won't be enough to defeat long-ranged Brawlers from a range, and is used to engage in close-ranged combat.",
      "In Showdown, Jacky's circular area damage mechanics along with her high damage is useful in some maps to destroy large groups of Power Cube Boxes in maps likeFeast or Famine,Dark Passage,Two Thousand LakesandAcid Lakes. However, since her range is short like other heavyweights, she should prioritize getting Power Cubes and should avoid immediate conflict with other Brawlers.",
      "In Brawl Ball, if an enemy holding the Ball gets caught in her Super, the Ball drops. This allows teammates to quickly steal the Ball or prevent an enemy from scoring. In addition, Jacky has a high damage output, high health, and a fast movement speed, which is better justified with her Pneumatic Booster Gadget, making Jacky very viable in this event.",
      "Jacky has the same movement speed as other heavyweights. This means that she can catch up to Brawlers that are escaping from her. If she has her Pneumatic Booster Gadget, this can be useful when chasing other fast Brawlers likeMaxand will help in game modes likeBrawl Ball,BountyandShowdown. With her high health as well, she can rush enemies and defeat them easily. However, be wary of slowing Gadgets and Supers likeBea's,Spike's,Lou's, andEmz's Super since they will slow Jacky down, making them outrange Jacky."

    ],
    "Strategies": [
      "Jacky can use her Super to pull in enemies before using her attack since she requires to be close to enemies to damage them. Note that her ammo won't recharge during her Super, so make sure to reload all your ammo before you use her Super. Jacky's Super can also be used to interrupt potentially dangerous Supers (likeCarl's orFrank's), or to drag away enemies from the goal in Brawl Ball to her. Pairing her with a Brawler that deals area damage is very effective when you use her Super, likeDynamike. First, pull the enemies in with your Super. Then, the other Brawler can attack the pulled in enemies with their Super, dealing massive damage and leading to a potential team-wipe, which can be devastating to enemies."
    ],
    "Other": [
      "Jacky's short range limits her offensive capabilities, but she has enough range to attack enemies that are at most a tile behind walls, which she can use to her advantage by attacking enemies behind walls. This strictly limits throwers that can otherwise take cover behind walls.",
      "Jacky's attack circles around her, which means that she can attack behind her, so if an enemy approaches you from behind, you can still hit them, as long as they are close to you. However, keep in mind that her attack is instantaneous, so you cannot run to extend your range.",
      "Jacky's attack is unique; auto-aiming or manually aiming renders the same attack direction and range. Because of this, players can focus on other aspects of the match such as dodging attacks and positioning, although players can still aim to see the attack range when they need to.",
      "Jacky, despite being a tank, can't outmatch other tanks. This is because she reloads rather slowly and doesn't deal enough damage to eliminate such Brawlers with three ammos. Since all other heavyweights reload faster and/or deal more damage than her (likeBull,El Primo,Bibi,Frank, orDarryl), she can neither defeat heavyweights in three shots nor can she reload fast enough to get a fourth one before getting eliminated. When facing Bull, Shelly,Griff,Spike, Leon,Nani,Buzz, or Darryl, try to stay out of their range as much as possible while attacking them. Using your Pneumatic Booster Gadget to escape from them is also possible.",
      "Jacky should focus on picking on low to medium health Brawlers or low-damaging and slow-reloading ones. If a Brawler reloads slower or deals less damage, Jacky can eliminate them easily as she has high health and can withstand three to five of their shots. In addition, make sure that the enemy has exhausted all their ammo so you can get close to them without taking major damage from being out-ranged.",
      "When trying to pull an enemy with your Super, try to drag the joystick to know if the enemy is in your Super range or not.",
      "Remember that Jacky does have a 1.8 second reload speed, so after attacking or defeating an enemy, you would want to stay out of the battle and heal up or reload your ammo, instead of going too aggressive on enemies."

In this case, use Kenji's high mobility to dodge shots and recharge the shield, and use the Hosomaki Healing Gadget to escape if something goes wrong."

      "When against Kenji, it is important to not get hit by his Super, as this not only heals him for a sizable amount, it contributes to a second Super, allowing him to chain Supers and become almost impossible to defeat. Kenji needs his targets to be in the center of the Super for maximum damage, so if you suspect he will Super on top of you, move in a non-diagonal direction to make both slashes miss.",
      "Chip damage is very useful when playing against Kenji as this prevents him from healing and reduces the effectiveness of his Hosomaki Healing Gadget. While his Nigiri Nemesis Star Power can help tank one shot, he remains vulnerable after that as dealing consistent chip damage to Kenji will prevent the shield from being activated again."

As a result, it is advisable to use the Gadget CooldownGear.The Vanish Gadget can be used to temporarily ignore enemy Brawlers and their spawnables likeNita's bear orJessie's turret, as a means of escaping from them, or to walk through them. For example, inHeist, you can use this Gadget to walk freely to the enemy team's safe without being harmed.You can also hide in a bush and wait for an enemy Brawler coming. You will know when an enemy is coming when your Super begins to automatically charge. You can then do 2120 damage or more and escape with your Vanish Gadget. This works especially well in SoloShowdown.You can use the Vanish Gadget to sneak into the enemy back lines without them noticing. There, you can ambush them after emerging from the Shadow Realm, taking them by surprise and dealing high damage to if not killing them.When you use the Vanish Gadget, try to remember where your opponents were and predict where they will be when you emerge from the Shadow Realm. This way, you can either avoid reappearing right next to a strong Brawler that will overpower you at close range, or purposefully reappear on a weak brawler and catch them by surprise.When playing against Lily and she uses her Vanish Gadget at low health to escape, try to predict where she will run to, so you can follow her there and be ready to finish her off once she reappears.Vanish's long cooldown means that, when playing against Lily, you can easily punish her for being too aggressive. If there is a Lily on the enemy team, space out at the start of the game to ensure Lily cannot hit all of you at once, but not too far that you cannot react if a teammate gets ambushed.When playing against Lily asCordelius, using your Super on any opposing player will also expose Lily to you if she used her Vanish Gadget.",

      "Using Lou's Ice Block gadget is little to none use when facing stun attacks such asFrank's and Buzz's Super,Dynamike's Satchel Charge Gadget,Fang's Roundhouse Kick Gadget, andBo's Snare a Bear Star Power as it stuns you afterwards."

      "When escaping an enemy Lou's Super, if possible, it's almost always better to turn lightly, up to 90 degrees, instead of making a U-turn as the deceleration would be limited by Lou's Super."
    ],
    "Other": [
      "Since his Super makes enemies slow down and makes maneuvering harder, enemies will attempt to escape by moving in the same direction, which makes attacks easier to hit and enemy movement to be predictable. With his Supercool Star Power, this is better justified and is more frivolous to enemies, because if they're stacked with the attacks and Super, they'll be quickly stunned and defeated, not to mention they'll also have trouble maneuvering. Additively, the more speed a Brawler has, the more struggle they have changing directions in Lou's Super. This makes Lou an ideal counter to speedy Brawlers like tanks, assassins, andMax.",
      "Lou has a great synergy with Edgar and other close-ranged Brawlers. Lou can stun and slow the enemies with his attack and Super (more effective with his Supercool Star Power), and the respective close-ranged Brawler can jump onto or ambush the affected enemies and quickly defeat them.",
      "Lou can stun enemies easily with 3 shots, which is useful inShowdown,Duo Showdown,Bounty, orLone Star, because he can quickly defeat enemies or quickly escape if he's in danger.",
      "When fighting brawlers such as Edgar, try to get at least 1/3 of the gauge filled up considering you use Ice Block as soon as Edgar jumps, that way Lou's slow unleash speed can freeze the enemy whole."

      "In certain game modes, controlling the bushes can provide a significant advantage. As a long-range Brawler, you can keep enemies at bay by shooting into bushes and denying them access to key areas. This method is effective in areas such asHot Zoneand Gem Grab.",
      "Maisie is a solid pick in Brawl Ball. Her Super, combined with her Tremors Star Power and Disengage! Gadget, can make the enemy drop the ball, push them away from the goal, stun them briefly, slow them, or provide area control if the enemies are grouping up together to defend their goal. This makes her a highly versatile Brawler in the mode; her very fast Super charge rate and high damage output allows her to eliminate enemies quickly if they're fired accurately.",
      "Maisie can take out a large and consistent amount of damage from the enemy's safe inHeist. Since the safe is a stationary object, her shots are guaranteed to hit. She can deal 11480 damage with three ammo and a super, and if there are multiple defending enemies in range, she could potentially chain Supers and repeatedly take out the enemy's safe's health. Her reload speed is quite reasonable, and her damage is consistent. Maisie's Super is great for defense as well, as it pushes enemies away from the safe and slows them down if she has her Tremors Star Power equipped, allowing her to take out the enemy and potentially chain another Super."
    ],
    "Recommended Build": [
      "If you're in a match facing an assassin, use Disengage! to stun them and dash away if they get too close to you. If you're facing any tanks, then use the Finish Them! gadget. A good tip would be to first attack them once or twice, then activate Finish Them! to wipe out their health.",
      "Maisie's Tremors Star Power is the better option for most situations, as it allows you to hit more consistent shots on your enemies after using your Super. Moreover, using her Super with this Star Power provides a much better area control than her regular Super, as it forces your opponents to retreat."
    ],
    "Strategies": [
      "A trick to use with her Super is to activate it, then use Disengage! to dash onto an enemy. With her Tremors Star Power, this should catch the enemy by surprise, and if they are on low health, it is easier to finish them off with her attack."
    ],
    "Other": [
      "Never auto-aim your shots when using Maisie, unless your opponent is right in front of you, as with the starting slow projectile speed, it most likely won't work.",
      "When aiming your Super as Maisie, try to corner brawlers into walls and activate your Super as you walk towards them. This will make it so that your Super hits accurately and you can cycle it back quickly thanks to a limited area available for your enemies to run.",
      "Maisie can defend herself well against close-range Brawlers, try to use this to your advantage by either dashing away or pushing back close-range Brawlers that sneak up on you likeMortis,Edgar,Buzz,El Primo,Fang, orMico. With the added slow from her Tremors Star Power, you can also efficiently charge her Super, due to the enemies being slowed.",
      "Maisie struggles against long-range Brawlers likePiper,Nani,Brock,Colt,Rico, orBea, but once Maisie can get in range, she can easily take them out. A good way to get in range, is to try and predict the shot of your enemy, dodge it, while also slowly moving closer to them.",
      "Maisie's Super is excellent for crowd control and pushing back enemies. Use it strategically in tight situations or to clear the area around an objective, such as the Gem Mine inGem Grabor theBrawl Ballgoal.",
      "To be effective with Maisie's attack, practice leading your shots. Anticipate where the enemy will be by the time the projectile reaches them, and adjust your aim accordingly. Accuracy and leading are critical for landing consistent shots.",
      "With a limited ammo capacity, it's very important that you make every shot count. Avoid spamming her main shots at random and try to land shots consistently to make sure you hit an opponent. Even though Maisie has a fast unload speed, its still important to make sure you land your shots and focus on aspects such as timing.",
      "Maisie can work well with Brawlers that provide healing, especially portable healing likeByron,Pam, orPocoto help her even more against sneak attacks. This allows her to stay in the battle longer and maintain map control."

      "Max's Super Charged Star Power works better in team events likeGem GraborHot Zonewhere Max will need to play as a support. Her Run n' Gun Star Power allows her to maintain the damage output of a typical sharpshooter and is preferred in Special Event modes likeBoss Fight,Super City Rampage, andRobo Rumble, where her Super Charged Star Power charges her Super much less efficiently than normal. InShowdown, choose your Star Power based on your play style; use Super Charged if you're more passive, and use Run n' Gun if you'll like picking fights and collecting Power Cubes.",
      "Max can use her Phase Shifter Gadget to absorb a high-damaging projectile likeNani's orMandy's Super to survive at crucial times or for a valuable teammate in order to help them survive. This, however, requires precise timing. Similarly, as long as you have sufficiently high health, Max can use her Sneaky Sneakers Gadget to absorb multiple projectiles and then teleport back safely with full health.",
      "Max's Sneaky Sneakers Gadget allows her to play aggressively for 3 seconds without major repercussions. After dropping it on the ground, take time pressuring enemies before returning to her original location for better opportunities. Do note that high-damaging enemies such asShelly,Bull,Spike,Brock,Leon,Griff,Buzz,Fang, Nani,El Primo, andDarrylcan ambush you when you teleport to your original location, as the location is made obvious by the icon Max leaves upon activating the Gadget, so therefore, refrain from using the Gadget near bushes or enemy spawn points.",
      "Max's Sneaky Sneakers Gadget is useful in Showdown when you want to defeat a vulnerable enemy such as a thrower but you are in danger of being third-partied by someone else. You can drop your Sneaky Sneakers Gadget and then try defeating the enemy. You'll likely be low on health after fighting the enemy, and will be a target for other enemies, but you'll teleport back to your Gadget's location and regain lost health. All the same, make sure to use this Gadget only when you're away from enemies, or contained by obstacles to avoid being ambushed where you'll teleport. Also, avoid staying too far from the Gadget location with your Super, because you'll never know who's attempting to ambush you when you return, and you should save your Super as an escape tool for such situations."

    "Strategies": [
      "Max can act like an assassin, using her fast reload speed and attack cooldown to burst enemies down and her movement speed to dodge enemy fire. After getting within range, follow and chip away at enemies until you eliminate them. If they manage to somehow escape, such as with Edgar's Super, use your Super and/or her Phase Shifter Gadget and rush them."
    ],
    "Other": [
      "Max's Super can be used to catch up to fleeing enemies or ensure an easier escape from pursuing enemies. This makes her good with guerrilla tactics because she can rush in with her Super, deal a lot of damage, and escape with her Super before she takes any serious damage.",
      "Auto-aiming at long range with Max, in most cases, will hit 3 of her projectiles. Because of this, auto-aiming is a good strategy while playing Max, but most of the time enemies are moving. Practice mirroring the enemy's movement to hit all 4 projectiles, and at the tip of her range, it's good to use practices commonly applied to sharpshooters.",
      "Max's attack has a range similar toTara's, and while it doesn't deal much damage if only one projectile hits, the fact that Max has 4 ammo slots, coupled with her much faster reload speed, attack cooldown, and tighter spread, means she can consistently provide suppressive fire and chip away at enemies, unlike most long-ranged Brawlers who reload slower.",
      "Max's Hypercharge energy drinks actually have a small splash radius, allowing them to charge the Supers of multiple allies. Although unpractical in most situations, if Max and her allies are stacked on top of each other (such as after respawning), using the Hypercharge and then Super will cause multiple energy drinks to hit all allies, granting them significant Super charge."

    "Game Modes and Maps": [
      "InBrawl Ball, you can self-pass by kicking the ball and dashing twice to pick it up again. If fast enough, you'll only need one dash to pick up the ball again to conserve ammo. You can also use your Super to shoot the ball (even on the side of the map) and dash forward onto the ball (with his Survival Shovel Gadget or a fully charged attack bar) to dribble the ball down the field extremely quickly. To do this, you can allow your teammates to distract the opposition, then quickly self-pass and score a goal. This distraction isn't necessary for more skilled players who can dash through all the action to the other side. When defending, try to aim backwards instead of auto-aiming when an enemy is near your goal. This gives you the chance to dash back and catch the Ball, therefore preventing a goal.",
      "InShowdown, you can't check bushes, so if you are moving into an unknown bush, be ready to dash away very quickly. Pre-aiming his attack away from the bush also helps, as once you see the enemy, you can instantly dash away from them. His Survival Shovel Gadget is also helpful to escape better from enemies camping in the bush. Take caution that Mortis is prone to defeat by other close-ranged Brawlers, so caution is highly recommended when going into a bush which likely has an enemy in it.",
      "In Showdown, Mortis can do well by simply bush-camping and staying out of fights, dashing away when necessary. If you see a fight between other Brawlers, you can play as a Third-Party by waiting out-of-sight nearby until the fight is over, then dash in and defeat the surviving and low-health Brawler, then steal all the Power Cubes and escape. Mortis' Survival Shovel Gadget greatly helps for this strategy.",
      "InGem Grab, Mortis is an excellent Gem carrier due to his above-average health, his ability to dash up to the Gem mine and retrieve Gems quicker, dashing away if on low health. He's also an excellent assassin in the mode as he can quickly assassinate one target, especially if they have all the Gems, or wipe out the whole team using his Super. However, he requires support from his teammates to survive, because he needs to get dangerously close to enemies and the Gem mine and it leaves your teammates at a 2v3 situation.",
      "Mortis' very slow reload speed and low damage output makes him a poor choice for Events such asHeistand any Special Event due to the low damage he deals to the modes' targets (i.e. the safe, the bosses, etc.)."
    ],
    "Recommended Build": [
      "Using his Coiled Snake Star Power is useful as it reduces the charging time for his attack bar. His Survival Shovel Gadget is also a useful asset as it boosts his reload speed and allows him to dash more quickly.",
      "Mortis' Creepy Harvest heals him for a considerable amount when defeating an enemy Brawler. It's sometimes necessary to be kept alive while taking fire from enemy Brawlers, especially in 3v3 modes.",
      "Mortis' Combo Spinner Gadget is fit for a quick finish to Brawlers when you have no ammo or when you need to deal damage to a group of enemies. On the other hand, his Survival Shovel Gadget is more efficient in the long-term when taking out high-health Brawlers or when retreating.",
      "You can increase Mortis' damage per second if you have equipped his Combo Spinner Gadget by simultaneously using this Gadget and main attack. You can use two fingers to achieve this. This can allow Mortis to deal with enemies grouped together and prioritize a single enemy (like the Gem carrier in Gem Grab)."
    ],
    "Strategies": [
      "Mortis' Super can act as a powerful fourth attack in tight situations. Use it when he's low on health and needs to heal quickly, or when the enemy is on low health and you can't reload an attack in time. Try not to use his Super as a first attack unless you are very low on health, and try to hit as many enemies as possible with Mortis' Super so that he recovers more health and charges his Super again much faster. It also has considerable range and travels quite quickly, which can be used to snipe low-health Brawlers even through walls."
    ],
    "Other": [
      "The dash that comes with Mortis' main attack makes him highly mobile. He can quickly dash away and out of danger, making it difficult to land hits on him. He can also retreat quickly due to his above-average movement speed and his Survival Shovel Gadget. In addition, his attack bar makes dashing more effective and much easier due to the increased range.",
      "When retreating/escaping, refrain from auto-aiming since you'll dash into the enemy you're trying to escape from. In addition, dashing to the side is favorable as opposed to dashing forward since you can dodge attacks better. Still, try to conserve your ammo, and if equipped with Mortis' Survival Shovel Gadget, use it sparingly in case you need to retreat.",
      "Mortis' reload speed is the second slowest in the entire game, which means that after you defeat an enemy, you should immediately retreat and reload. If possible, try charging his attack bar up to retreat more effectively.",
      "Mortis' long dash from his attack bar allows him to close a significant gap between enemies and gives him a chance to get closer to enemies. Using this mechanic effectively requires preparation and being unpredictable, such as bush-camping and attacking when someone comes near. It also allows him to get close to certain close-ranged Brawlers and slash through them and out of their range. This can be used repeatedly to deal damage and charge Mortis' Super all the while taking minimal damage.",
      "At the start of a Showdown match, try to go for defeats rather than Boxes as it takes a long time for Mortis to open boxes and it's also likely for the Power Cube to be stolen by an enemy, who can also defeat the nearby Mortis who will have no remaining ammo after trying to open the box. Pick off long-ranged Brawlers with low health like Brock,Dynamike,Tick, Colt,Nani,Bea,Barley,Crow, Piper,Meg, orRicowhile juking shots. Bush-camping and surprising enemies also works well. However, don't get hit by dangerous Supers or Gadgets (i.e. Rico's,Colt‘s,Piper‘s, etc.). You should also be wary of Brawlers who have a stun or slow in their kit such as Dynamike's Satchel Charge Gadget, because both effects can be detrimental to you. If going for Power Cube Boxes is necessary, try to use two dashes first, preferably close to a wall to attack faster, then let your ammo fully reload before destroying it. If a dangerous enemy comes by, you can use your ammo to escape rather than have it be wasted on a Box you couldn't destroy. There are some maps likeDark PassageandScorched Stonewhere if you manage to get the entire middle area of Power Cubes, you will most likely have an advantage over enemies that would previously counter you.",
      "Mortis is a satisfactory counter toBibias Mortis can keep dashing through Bibi during the delay before her attack, dealing damage to her while avoiding her attacks. However, this requires a lot of skill and timing, and should be done with his Survival Shovel Gadget for better results. You can firstly dash behind her to surprise her, then use your Survival Shovel Gadget, and while Bibi is attacking behind her, dash in front of her and then repeat this process. Be aware that the Bibi may know what you are doing (and thus swing opposite the direction you are currently in). This also works againstFrankandAshbut is more difficult due to their higher health.",
      "Mortis is excellent at performing team-wipes, especially with either Gadget and his Creepy Harvest Star Power. If the enemies are grouped up, you can ambush them, activate his Gadget, and chain Supers. The healing from his Super and Creepy Harvest ensures that he stays alive. Hitting multiple enemies with his Super also helps him survive longer and heal even more. However, it's best to avoid attacking heavyweights or other assassins as they'll defeat him if he gets too close to them due to their superior damage and much faster reload speed than Mortis.",
      "Mortis makes an excellent counterpick in Bounty and Knockout because low-health Brawlers are mainly picked in Bounty such asBrock, Piper,Sprout, Rico, andTickand Mortis can dodge their attacks with his dashes, dash up to them, and swiftly defeat them with all of his three ammo paired up with his Combo Spinner if needed. Mortis can also use his Survival Shovel Gadget to quickly steal the blue star. However, Mortis must be wary as these Brawlers have abilities that can counter him such as Tick's or Piper's Supers.",
      "Mortis' unload speed can be reduced by dashing into walls, useful for if an enemy is standing next to one. This can be useful for quick eliminations, and in some specific situations too, such as preventing an enemy walk-in Brawl Ball goal, or opening boxes in Showdown.",
      "When targeting enemy Brawlers in corridors, try to refrain from dashing at them while angled to the corridor's entrance, as this will increase the chance of you dashing into a wall."

    "Game Modes and Maps": [
      "In Special Events such asBoss Fight,Robo RumbleandBig Game, Mr. P's Super can prove very useful as the porters can distract the enemies, and if a porter is destroyed, another one spawns to take its place. His Revolving Door Star Power makes this more of a threat.",
      "InSiege, throwing your home base inside the IKE zone can serve as a meat shield for you as long as it is closer to the IKE, causing the IKE to target it instead of you. This gives you more time to dive into the IKE to land extra shots and is amplified with his Revolving Door Star Power, which gives the porters additional health and therefore give you an even better meat shield. His Service Bell Gadget amplifies this further, as it can instantly heal a low health porter back to full health.",
      "Mr. P can be a real nuisance on maps a plethora of bushes, such asSnake Prairie, as his porters can flush out hidden enemies. This strategy works even better with his Porter Reinforcements Gadget, so Mr. P can instantly root out enemies at the start of the match without a Super."
    ],
    "Recommended Build": [
      "On maps with an abundance of walls, it's usually a good idea to use his Handle With Care Star Power, as the walls give Mr. P plenty of opportunities to utilize the extra damage that the Star Power provides.",
      "Mr. P’s Porter Reinforcements Gadget is a good way to block shots from enemies, making them expend their ammo on the porter despite its low health. It can also effectively counter Brawlers that have difficulty defending themselves at close range such asPiperor Brawlers with low damage or a slow reload speed. Using the Gadget right in front of an enemy can sometimes force them to retreat, allowing Mr. P to hit them with his attack and deal twice the damage.",
      "Mr. P's Handle With Care Star Power is better on damage orientated modes, such asHeist, because it can help melt the safe quicker, although it is not advisable to play Mr. P in Heist as he has a low damage output by himself without porters."
    ],
    "Strategies": [
      "Mr. P's attack is unique in that it bounces after hitting an obstacle or target. If you throw attacks at walls, you can hit enemies behind them, like a thrower. This only works with one-tile-thick walls. If you hit a Brawler, the attack can hit them again if they stand still or are running away from you, effectively doubling your damage per hit against fleeing targets.",
      "Continue to set up a home base when taking control of lanes in battles. Mr. P's Super can be charged consistently which allows them to secure control faster using their Super. It also means it's safe to bring the base further into the battlefield where it can be of more use. Take into note that sometimes spawning a new home base is better then that of waiting for a porter to spawn since a porter immediately spawns right when it's placed down."
    ],
    "Other": [
      "Mr. P is a very versatile Brawler due to his pseudo-thrower attacks and his range. Taking note of the enemy's movement and position can be vital when dealing maximum damage with the bounce from his attack.",
      "In a pinch, his porters can be used as a meat shield to hide behind them and heal up or attack the enemy. This should only be used in situations likeShowdownor the last few seconds inBountyorSiege. Watch out forPenny,Jessie,Belle,Carl,Rico,Ruffs,Tara,Bibi,Grom, and other piercing or bouncing Brawlers though, since they can hit through spawnables, including Mr. P's porters."

      "Because of the large spread of her attack, Nani is best used in very open maps. Playing her in open maps would minimize any collisions of the projectiles hitting a wall that would decrease her damage. In addition, open maps minimize any accidental cases of Nani's Super being wasted on a wall.",
      "Nani's high damage per ammo makes her an excellent choice inHeist. UnlikeSpike,Griff, andLeon, she can utilize her attacks from a distance to hit the safe, allowing her to play more safely."

      "Nani's Warpin' Time Gadget can be used to reach the enemy safe inHeist, enemy's territory inTrophy Thieves, and the Ball inBrawl Ballmore quickly.",
      "Do not use the Return To Sender Gadget when you are using the Tempered Steel Star Power especially when it is activated, as the Star Power would decrease the amount of the damage Nani receives, the effectiveness of the Gadget will be reduced significantly.",
      "Try not to activate her Return To Sender Gadget when you are near to a Brawler which shoots multiple low damage projectiles, such asColt,Rico, Pam,8-Bit,Lola, etc. You will only return a little bit of damage to the enemy Brawler if you use this Gadget against an enemy like this. Only use it when you're going to take one-time high damage, such asMandy,Tick, andDynamike's Super, another Nani's Super, a far-rangedPiperbullet, or a superchargedBeashot. This requires some practice and fast reflexes but if utilized well, it can be game-changing. If you can't properly apply Nani's Return to Sender Gadget in adequate time, you can use it as a temporary 80% shield for one projectile.",
      "Tempered Steel is extremely strong inSuper City RampageandSiegeas she can take a lot of hits from the Mega Monster or robot, and she can take even more when a Brawler likePam,Poco, orByronis healing her.",
      "Tempered Steel essentially quintuples her health, allowing her to escape or hide when coupled with Warpin' Time, such as inBig Game. Overall, Nani's Super puts her in a very vulnerable position, but the shield provides enough value to deter enemies. Not bursting Nani down completely during its duration allows her to potentially two-shot enemies near her without fear of repercussions."
    ],
    "Strategies": [
      "Nani, having very high damage per attack if all orbs hit, and a similarly high damaging Super that can also knock back enemies who get too close, is a very effective tank counter. To make use of this ability, the best way to kill tanks, especially heavyweights, is to maintain a medium range of around 4-5 tiles from the enemy, which allows Nani to hit her shots easier without giving the enemy time to dodge them, while also staying just out of the range of their high damaging attacks. If they get close enough to you, use your Super to knock them back and deal extra damage. Don't be afraid to get close to them, however, if they are low on health, as you can find it hard to kill a skilled dodger at a range.",
      "Because of Nani's unique attack pattern, her shots can be fired at enemies camping behind walls, although normally only 1 of the 3 orbs will hit an enemy. If possible, you can use the unique diamond path of the two outer orbs to hit an enemy behind a wall.",
      "To hit enemies accurately with Nani, try to lead your shots slightly ahead of them, meaning if they're walking away from you, you'd shoot slightly above them."
    ],
    "Other": [
      "Only auto-aim Nani's attack if the enemy is running directly in front you or if the enemy is standing still; otherwise it will most likely miss. Always try to manually aim your main attack when using Nani.",
      "Pay attention to enemies with canceling capabilities like knockback, pull, and stun. If Nani is moved from Peep's original casting spot, Peep will disappear. Also note that Peep can't be directly destroyed; however, it can be interrupted by walls, immunity bubbles, pets, etc. When using Nani's Super, wait for the target to either lose their shield or use their pet when going against an enemy with any of these.",
      "Before using Nani's Super, hide away from any enemies, preferably in bushes, then use her Super. Never use Nani's Super when she's in the middle of a battle, as it leaves Nani vulnerable to enemy attacks. Although this weakness can be alleviated with Nani's Star Power Tempered Steel to shield her, Nani is still vulnerable to being knocked back or stunned which will cause her Super to disappear without exploding.",
      "Unless within close range of an enemy Brawler, never auto-aim your Super because of the fact that it goes towards the nearest enemy. The direction it will go in may cause you to struggle to control Peep. Try to manually aim your Super so that it starts off in the direction that you want it to go, then control Peep with your movement joystick.",
      "You can use Nani's Super as an additional attack when you are in close-quarters with a short-ranged Brawler. This can be very useful as hitting enemies with Peep deals damage and knocks back, allowing you to escape or defeat them from a distance.",
      "Be careful when activating Nani's Hypercharged Super as while it allows you to hit enemies more easily, it also increases the chances of Peep hitting obstacles. Only use this when the map is very open with almost no walls for you to get an easier hit on the enemy."

      "To maximize the lifespan of the cannon, one of the very optimal placements for it is behind walls on the player's side of the map. The turret's extremely long range allows it to shoot cannonballs to the enemy's side of the map from the safety of the player's side and it is protected from enemy fire when behind walls. Additionally, close-ranged Brawlers' movement will be restricted by the walls when trying to take the turret down, causing them to be hit by its cannonballs.",

If you are a more close-ranged brawler juke her shots by moving side to side while steadily advancing to her. Piper is only easy to defeat at close range, otherwise she will definitely put up a good fight from long range.",
      "Piper can be overwhelmed and defeated easily if she is unprotected due to her low health and very slow reload, as well as the fact that she only does sufficient damage from distance. Piper is most effective when she is covered by other Brawlers on her team. If enemies do get too close, it may be a good idea to use Piper's Super to escape if the Super is charged. You need to aim too because otherwise, you land in the place from where you jumped.",
      "Piper has a very defensive Super since it only affects the area right near her, but it can also be used offensively in a riskier play. Piper can rush the enemy team, drop the grenades, and fly away. In addition, she can use her Super to destroy enemy cover to open up the map. This plays to her advantage because her long range is more effective in open maps.",
      "When escaping, always try your best to aim Piper away from the enemy rather than auto-aiming because if you quickfire her super, she will only land in the place from where she activated her super, without covering any distance. However, if you are in a very pressurized situation and your enemy has short range, you can quickfire the Super because the knockback of the grenades is reliable to distance yourself from them. However, always aim the landing point when you can.",
      "Charge up Piper's Super as a priority, as there are Brawlers that can pop right in such asDarryl,Bull,Mortis,Shelly,El Primo,Buzz,Leon, andEdgar. If you have your Auto Aimer Gadget, use it primarily to escape as its offensive capabilities are negligible.",
      "Assassin Brawlers are a major counter to Piper due to their above-average speed and abilities that help them dodge and reach her very easily (Mortis' andKenji's dash,Mico's jump,Crow's, Edgar's,Melodie's, Buzz's,Fang's,Shade's and Leon's Supers, andStu's Hypercharge etc.), so it is best to avoid and keep an eye on them from distance.",
      "Think carefully when it comes to the position of Piper's landing after her Super. Since it takes a long time for her to land, it is easy for the enemy to predict where she will end up. Try going to places that the enemy will take a long time to reach such as across water regions or behind walls, but make sure you do not land close to the location of other enemies."

      "Poco is great at supporting allies due to his ability to heal them using his Super, his Tuning Fork Gadget, and his Da Capo! Star Power. Prioritize healing over damaging enemies with Poco because Poco's healing can help teammates win many battles and interactions by keeping them alive.",
      "Remember, Poco's attack has a wide spread but doesn't deal much damage. This means he's not used as a front line attacker, but rather used for effective support. Positively, the spread allows him to hit multiple targets at once and charge his Super quickly. The wide spread of his attack also allows him to check large bushes.",
      "Poco's attacks can be released in quick succession, allowing him to attack an enemy Brawler multiple times to charge his Super quickly before retreating to reload again, or heal a teammate quickly and effectively with his Da Capo! Star Power.",
      "Poco's healing abilities are more useful thanPam's in tight situations when you or your teammates are on low health, as Pam's Super takes time, while Poco's Super is instant and occurs in a much larger area. This makes his healing considerably more useful than that of Pam in offense and survival-oriented modes likeBountywhere teammates cannot afford to stay near Pam's turret for long.",
      "Poco is amazing when paired up with tanks as Poco can continuously replenish their health while they keep Poco safe from stronger Brawlers and control the map. Using Poco's Tuning Fork Gadget and Poco's Da Capo! Star Power will be more ideal in this case, since with them, Poco can heal allies even without his Super."

Additionally, his piercing and high-damage Super enables him to inflict substantial damage on robots, further enhancing his effectiveness on the battlefield.",

However, it's very inconsistent as the bullets spread out from him, so it's best to use this Gadget at point-blank range so all of the bullets can hit a target. However, this Gadget is mainly used in an enclosed area where the bullets will bounce multiple times and guarantee a hit to an enemy trapped in the area.",
      "Rico's Bouncy Castle Gadget makes bouncing shots off of walls a necessity due to the healing applied to each bounce, and the healing can assist him in modes likeBountywhere one's intent is to secure defeats without being defeated. It's extremely useful when you're on low health and hitting an enemy behind a wall, as it can heal you while damaging the enemy. However, in order to heal significantly, you'll need to bounce the bullets off of multiple walls, so it's never wrong to use the Gadget in the intention of healing and not damaging enemies, given Rico's very fast reload speed.",

While it doesn't seem like much additional damage for each bullet, when all five bullets are bounced, an additional 1280 damage is added, making his total damage 4480. Similarly, a bounced Super will deal a total of 11712 damage. This encourages Rico to bounce shots off walls for them to deal more damage (especially in maps likeSnaked AssaultandTurnaround) where he has the potential to bounce his shots from a safe distance. However, don't shoot Rico's Super directly onto a target and expect the bullets to deal damage to the target again when they bounce off another wall, as his Super's bullets only deal damage once, and to properly use this Star Power, you must bounce the Super off a wall in such a way that the bounced shots hit the target and not the normal shots.",
      "Rico's Robo Retreat Star Power allows Rico to perform guerrilla tactics by rushing into fights and then escaping when you're on low health. Doing so allows more of your bullets to hit enemies due to the increased accuracy. If you're a good sniper, you should back away from fights and attack from a distance. If you're a good dodger, you can keep firing to prevent Rico from healing and stay below 40% health to use the speed buff to dodge enemy fire and even outrun fast Brawlers likeMortis,Edgar,Leon,Max,Mico, andCrow.",
      "Rico is one of the few Brawlers that is able to equip theReload Gear.

Also, you cannot miss the advantages of Air Superiority (to break walls and team-wipe the opposition) for the other 's rather ineffective power. It's also vital to note that after scoring a goal, power-ups are lost so power-ups may not be very useful, but his Air Superiority Star Power is still beneficial as it can knock enemies from the ball and destroy cover (especially goal barriers), so you need to strategically aim your Super to give extra benefit.",

In both Solo and Team events, getting your Super quickly is essential.",
      "Ruffs' attacks can be utilized likeRico's attacks since they bounce off walls, and his attack shoots two projectiles, so he can hit enemies without coming under fire himself due to his relatively low health. This can be handy when playing in maps with many walls, such asCavern Churn. In order maximize your chances of hitting the enemy with both of your shots, utilize manual aim wherever possible. If you aim correctly, Ruffs can offer a lot of offensive power. His Double-Barrel Laser can deal moderate damage as well as his Super. The offensive power of Ruffs increases if he is buffed by a power-up or using his Air Superiority Star Power.",
      "In any mode with teammates, make sure each of your allies receive a power-up from Ruffs' Super, allowing you and your team to have an advantage. The immediate heal from a power-up offers some protection to low-health Brawlers. If the teammate in question is not behind cover, saving a power-up for more vital situations is more effective. If you have a Super ready and everyone on the team is buffed by it (they've all picked up a power-up each), you may also throw the Super near your team's respawn point, so that should someone get defeated, they can immediately pick up a power-up and get back into action."

      "Sandy's Rude Sands Star Power can be used for area control, and while the damage over time is minor, the large radius and long duration prevents healing and can slowly drain the enemies' health if they enter the sandstorm and the area it's placed on, allowing you and your teammates to possibly defeat them or force the enemy to stay far from the area, which is very effective for area control-based events such as Gem Grab and Hot Zone. Sandy's Rude Sands Star Power also counters other Sandy's Supers. If you throw your Super onto their Super, the damage ticks make enemies visible. This makes it much easier for your team to fight against the opposing Sandy. Sandy's Rude Sands Star Power can also be used in maps with an abundance of bushes such asSnake PrairieorCavern Churnto detect bush-camping enemies."

In mirror matches or against medium-range Brawlers, this can be helpful, but her Fast Forward Gadget can give Shelly more advantage. It allows her to get in close range to enemies and ambush them, potentially surprising them if she dashes from a bush. Sometimes, though, you will find yourself using Clay Pigeons in situations where an enemy on low health is out of your normal range and you need to finish them off (like when they have a lot of gems inGem Grabor to secure a quick elimination inBountyorKnockout, which could potentially give your team a victory)."

      "Spike is versatile inHeistthanks to his high damage output: he can either go on defence with his unpredictable spread of attack and slowing Super, or go on the offense with his extreme damage output. Tanks who are favoured in this mode (i.e.Bull,Darryl, orEl Primo) are countered by Spike, as without their Supers, they struggle to reach the opposing team's safe with their short range, and with Spike's slowing Super and damage, he can easily take them down at range. If Spike is positioned correctly or is at point-blank range of the safe, he can deal devastatingly high damage to it with his Popping Pincushion Gadget along with his high-damaging attack, which makes him a solid choice. Popping Pincushion can also serve as a fourth attack or during defence since Spike reloads slowly.",
      "When defending a critical objective or controlling an area, Spike's Super and his Fertilize Star Power are useful for area denial, slowing and damaging enemies while healing himself. If the enemy team is fleeing with Gems inGem Grabor attempting to score a goal inBrawl Ball, you can hamper them from doing so with your Super."

If you find yourself charging your Super too often, don't hesitate to use it on yourself to heal you fully while you keep attacking enemies. If you or teammates are low on health and your Super isn't charged up, you can spawn your Life Plant Gadget down, hide behind it, and heal up. The extra healing his Life Plant provides when it's destroyed makes it even better for supporting Spike and teammates. These mechanics are also useful inShowdownwhen facing high-damaging enemies or in self-defense, especially in Showdown when being ambushed or pinched.",
      "Spike's Curveball Star Power makes his attacks much more dangerous and unpredictable, which makes it a pretty good choice in most situations. This means that enemies will have more difficulty dodging his shots, providing advantages to Spike's team.",
      "A tip when playing against Spike: if the opposing Spike has Curveball Star Power equipped, here's what you can try in order to dodge his shots. Go a little left below the projectile (make sure not to collide with it, as it will split immediately and deal damage), just below the end of Spike's range, and as the shot splits, move upwards, go right, go down, and then go left (do this in quick succession). This means that you will spin in a clockwise circle. As Curveball always rotates at 75 degrees, his shots will split (in your vision) from right to left. Thus, walking from left to right allows you to just miss the spread of his attack. Going up and going down allows you to go back to the same position as you were before. This takes a lot of practice, but can be very effective when put into play."
    ],
    "Strategies": [
      "Spike has low health and a slow reload speed. Because of this, it's best to practice shooting around obstacles, predicting his shot pattern, and predicting the enemy's movement to prevent opportunities for the enemies to damage you. However, his high damage output compensates for his low health and allows him to defeat enemies easily.",
      "Spike's attack can deal devastating damage. One way to deal that maximum damage is at point-blank range of the enemy where his attack and Popping Pincushion Gadget work best at that range. This makes him an excellent counter against close-ranged Brawlers likeEl Primo,Rosa,Sam,Edgar,Kit,Fang,Lily,Mico, andMortiswho need to get close to Spike to damage him.",
      "Spike is capable of dealing extremely high damage to grouped-up enemies due to the multiple spikes shot out from his attack on impact. His Super's area damage can also spell trouble for grouped-up enemies since they can't easily escape from Spike's attack or Popping Pincushion Gadget due to the slow effect. This becomes more effective using Spike Mythic Gear Sticky Spikes.",
      "The 6 spikes that fly out from his attack always spread out in the same pattern (60-degree angles, or 75 degrees with Curveball) no matter your position or rotation. You can use this to know where the spikes will land, making it easier to hit enemies around corners and obstacles or to check bushes. Because of this, having the cactus explode near a target is vital because this increases the chances of multiple spikes hitting the same target."

As a result, it's difficult for Sprout to attack enemies that are close to it unless nearby walls are used to assist them, which will allow Sprout's attacks to reach enemies easier.

Because of this, you can auto-aim with Sprout unlike other throwers as the attack can bounce on the ground and off walls.",

Similarly, his Super and attack can be used to completely close off lanes and/or weaken enemies who are in your lane (more effectively with his slowing Star Power) to secure control of your lane. His attack's delay,  large radius and sticky effect coupled with his Super's area denial makes him an ideal control and lane defense Brawler.",

      "While Squeak's Super can cover a good chunk of the map, the bombs don't have a large range and experienced players can deter it. Aim it likeTick's attack to prevent enemies from entering a point.",

However, some high-burst damage Brawlers like Spike,Edgar, Buzz,El Primo, Griff, Leon,Nani,Emz, Shelly, Darryl, orBullcould pop out of bushes and eliminate you easily due to Squeak's attack delay, so you need to check bushes more frequently or stay in an open area.",
      "If you throw your Super directly onto an enemy, most, if not all of the blobs will attach to them, dealing massive damage after a short delay. This can be used to weaken a brawler, allowing your teammates to finish them off. It also charges your super by a significant amount, allowing you to repeatedly chain your Super. Practice aiming Squeak's Super directly onto an enemy and planning a precise hit on moving targets for proficiency in using Squeak's Super in this way.",

This can have plenty of unique and unpredictable outcomes, such as attaching Sticky Blombs to minecarts inMinecart Madnessso they travel to enemies and (along with the minecart's 2000 damage) knock them out, should they become trapped, or attaching it to spawnables such asPam's healing station or8-Bit's Damage Booster to prevent enemies from going near them.",
      "Since Squeak has a delayed attack, there is a chance that your opponent could defeat you first, so you should maintain distancing from enemies, especially heavyweights and assassins, who can easily defy the delayed and slow-reloading attack. This still works effectively because Squeak is ideal at keeping control and keeping your opponents away."

    "Game Modes and Maps": [
      "Stu is solid inHot Zone. He can hit the enemies from afar and use his Super to dash towards zones. In addition, his quick burst attacks and his Super that allows him to dodge enemy fire make him a deadly and hard to hit target while fighting and allows him to gain better control of the zones.",
      "Stu is decent inBig Gamebecause he can dash around and dodge enemy fire, and he can burn the enemies with his Super as the Big Boss. As a Hunter, he can use his Speed Zone Gadget for enhanced mobility and he can continuously poke the Big Boss while dashing unpredictably and quickly.",
      "Stu is outstanding inBrawl Ball/Trophy Thieves/Volley Brawl/Basket Brawlbecause of his high mobility with his Super. In addition, Stu can self-pass by kicking the ball/trophy ahead and dashing forward to retrieve it back, then continuously hitting the enemies from afar to recharge and chain Supers so he can dash towards the ball/trophy."
    ],
    "Recommended Build": [
      "Stu's Speed Zone Gadget should be kept behind obstacles so it's protected from enemies. He can also use it at the team's spawn point of the map to help him and his allies get back into action after being defeated or as a temporary shield to block shots from enemies that can't hit multiple targets.",
      "Although a niche technique, you can use Stu's Breakthrough Gadget as a way to escape, if your path is blocked by a wall. this is mostly useful if you get ambushed by a close range brawler near a wall.",
      "Stu's Breakthrough Gadget is helpful as it can destroy obstacles. He can use it to defeat enemies who are taking cover behind obstacles or to destroy the goalpost in Brawl Ball to score goals at ease.",
      "With Stu's Zero Drag Star Power, he can escape a directEdgarjump. with some follow up shots and Supers,  you should be able to easily defeat an enemy Edgar. Keep this in mind in Solo Showdown.",
      "Stu's Zero Drag Star Power makes self-passing the ball in Brawl Ball and dodging shots easier and makes opponents harder to hit while dashing around. It also allows him to collect vital items such asSiegeBolts faster, to reach a certain area of the map faster, or to better counter close-ranged Brawlers as he can dash out of their range more effectively.",
      "With his Gaso-Heal Star Power, Stu can use his attack and Super in quick succession to quickly heal up in a pinch because of his fast Super charge rate and fast unload speed. You can dash around and heal and use this as an alternative to self-regeneration."
    ],
    "Strategies": [
      "Stu can actually get two Supers from one attack. If you attack an enemy and the first projectile lands, there is a small window for you to use your Super before the second projectile hits, essentially granting a free second Super. This is tricky to pull off though.",
      "Stu can poke effectively by using his Super, his fast unload speed, and his attack's fast Super charge rate. He can fire a shot at an enemy, then dash backwards to avoid their counter fire. This recharges Stu's Super if the shot lands, which allows him to continuously poke, and once they're low on health, you can use your Super to get close to them and burst your attacks to finish them off."
    ],
    "Other": [
      "Since Stu charges his Super with only one projectile, despite being the assassin with the slowest movement speed, he can easily escape with his Super in dangerous situations, which makes him highly mobile and allows him to dodge enemy fire with ease. Stu can use his Super to dodge an attack once, get another hit that recharges his Super, and use the Super again to escape unharmed.",
      "When Stu's Super is auto-aimed, he dashes in the direction that he is facing. Thus, auto-aiming is useful to escape from enemies chasing you or to engage long-ranged Brawlers by dashing randomly and dodging their shots.",
      "Stu's Super makes him an outstanding counter to close-ranged Brawlers because Stu can hit them once and dash away and out of their range, and then attack them with ease. Use this to your advantage when facing close-ranged Brawlers.",
      "Stu's fast Super charge rate, his high mobility with his Super, and his quick burst attacks make him niche in offense-oriented modes such asBounty. However, Stu's attack doesn't pierce, so he does best in a 1v1 situation where he can continuously poke at the enemy and dodge their attacks.",
      "Stu has the fastest-charging Super in the game, but it’s still important to always have one ready. This helps you stay prepared and escape tricky situations. Try to save your Supers by using them only when you know you can hit an enemy and charge another one, or after you start shooting and think your shot will land.",
      "If you use Stu often, consider making your Gadget button much larger in Training Ground, as you will need to activate both Gadgets very quickly. This only applies to the Speed Zone Gadget if you are planning on using it as a meat shield."

      "InShowdown, a strategy that can be used is to hide in a bush. After a while, find two enemy Brawlers fighting each other and strike. Use her Super to gather them together and finish them off with her main attack.",
      "Tara can be effective in Brawl Ball if she has her Super after a goal has been scored, as she can take out the whole enemy team when they are clustered together at the start of a round. Her Super can also be used to drag in enemies in front of the enemy goal, potentially destroying enemy cover and setting up an opportunity to score.",
      "Tara's Black Portal Star Power shadow has very low health, but has a good damage output, can run extremely fast, and can detect Brawlers hiding in bushes, making it more of a scouting tool rather than an offensive Star Power. It can also be a valuable offensive attack on the Heist safe.",
      "In Brawl Ball, surprise enemies by using the destruction radius at the center of her Super to break a hole in the wall in most maps. This feature of her Super is especially useful if her teammates are long-ranged Brawlers or Brawlers with high spread, as freeing up the map allows them to control larger areas and be more effective when pressuring the enemy team."
    ],
    "Recommended Build": [
      "Tara's Healing Shade shadow has very low health, but a decent amount of range and a high amount of healing. As long as enemies are kept away from the shadow, it can provide lots of extra health for your team. However, this might put you at a disadvantage on maps where bush concealment is crucial since the shadow will produce healing effects that reveal your location to enemies.If Tara has her Healing Shade Star Power and her teammate(s) are low on health, it's better to throw a portal away from enemies so that Tara's shadow can heal longer. Throwing the portal into a crowd of people is always a great technique, but the shadow will get taken out much faster. Decide how to use her Super based on the situation, if you have this Star Power.",

      "Tara's Psychic Enhancer Gadget is great in maps with lots of bushes, likeSnake PrairieandCavern Churn. It works better with teammates likeShelly,Bull,Leon,El Primo,Spike,Griff,Buzz, orDarryl, who can creep up on enemies in bushes exposed by Tara’s Gadget whilst being entirely concealed.",
      "Tara's Support from Beyond Gadget is very useful in Heist. If all three shadows attack, they can deal incredibly high amounts of damage to the safe as long as no other enemy is in range, the shadow summoned from her Black Portal Star Power can add some extra damage.You can also use Tara's Support from Beyond Gadget to tank shots from single target Brawlers such asPiper,Belle, orBea.",

    ],
    "Strategies": [
      "When being pursued by fast Brawlers likeMax, tanks, or assassins, it is wise to throw Tara's Super behind them, pulling them away from you so that you can escape. If being chased by a low-health Brawler, you can then surprise them by unloading all three of your attacks quickly, as Tara deals reasonably high damage at close range. Don't try this with high health brawlers as Tara does not have enough damage and does not reload fast enough to kill them before they kill you. Instead, chip away at their health from a range, using your Super to pull them near you to finish them off."
    ],
    "Other": [
      "Her main attack can be really useful when many rival Brawlers are gathered in a small area since it not only deals damage to more than one enemy but helps to build up her Super faster.",
      "Once Tara's Super is charged, try to pull in as many enemies as possible, attacking them while they are being pulled in. Hitting enough Brawlers allows her to quickly charge another Super.Try to use Tara's Super when near teammates to maximize the chance of a team wipe as well. Doing so will open up huge opportunities especially in game modes such asBrawl Ball,Heist,Gem Grab, andDuo Showdown.",

      "It is crucial to conserve Tara’s ammo before using her Super. Because enemies are drawn towards the middle of her Super, they will not be able to attack for a short period; letting Tara use attacks on her opponents without being attacked. Also, bear in mind that her ammunition reload speed is rather slow, so allow extra time to pass if her ammo is exhausted and she is about to spring an attack.",
      "Tara's Super is very useful if paired with other Supers, such asDynamike's,Frank's, El Primo's,Mandy's, Shelly's,Barley's,Carl's, Spike's, orPearl's Super. Tara can draw enemies together with her Super so that her teammate can hit multiple enemies with theirs. These combos can deal a massive amount of damage and wipe out the enemy team.",
      "If there are a cluster of Power Cubes, find a bush nearby and use it as bait. Wait until an enemy comes to collect them, then use Tara's Super to delay them from reaching the Power Cubes. When you collect the Power Cubes, finish them off with her main attack."

      "Due to Tick's very slow reload speed, he's not often recommended inHeist, so be sure to use him wisely in this mode. On offense, hide and attack the safe behind obstacles, which is effective as you'll deal high damage to the safe while the enemies can't hit you, and if possible, use his Mine Mania Gadget, his Super, and his Automa-Tick Reload Star Power to amplify your damage potential on the safe. On defense, hide behind obstacles and block off any choke points that inadvertently allow enemies to damage the safe, and, if possible, use his Last Hurrah Gadget and his Super to knock enemies away from the safe.",
      "Tick is a useful asset inKnockout. Tick is most useful in closed maps where he can hide and attack from behind walls. He can control areas with his mines and his Super allows him to finish off low-health enemies and is a counter to assassins and heavyweights. His Star Powers and his Gadgets are beneficial in this mode: Well Oiled allows Tick to recover from damage insanely quickly, and Automa-Tick Reload allows him to attack faster; Mine Mania makes him momentarily deal even more damage, finishing off enemies more efficiently or covering more ground, and Last Hurrah allows him to withstand more damage and counter heavyweights and assassins.",
      "Tick is niche inShowdownbecause of his long range, control abilities, and high damage output. However, he's more effective inDuo Showdownbecause of a teammate that can mitigate his weaknesses such as his low health and his struggle in close-ranged combat. He can annoy enemies by placing mines all around them and they'll have to escape by walking into the mines and taking high damage, and if the enemies aren't already dead, Tick's teammate can finish those enemies off. In addition, Tick can trap enemies in the poison gas by continuously deploying mines at exit points until they die to the poison gas.",
      "Tick has the lowest health of any Brawler and a very slow reload speed, but his long range, area denial abilities, and high damage output compensate for these weaknesses. Hence, it's a necessity to take cover and attack from behind walls while playing Tick. Tick thrives in maps with an abundance of walls such asOpen Plazabecause he can stay behind the walls and support himself and his teammates."
    ],
    "Recommended Build": [],
    "Strategies": [
      "Tick's mines are more effective if Brawlers likeGale,Bibi,El Primo,Shelly,Jacky, orGenepush, knock, or pull enemies into them, dealing massive damage to the enemies. If you see the respective Brawler with their disruptive ability charged up, you'll want to throw your mines in the direction the enemy will head.",
      "If Tick is being chased by close-ranged Brawlers, refrain from auto-aiming because Tick's mines will simply go over the enemy's head. To defend yourself, aim mines between yourself and the enemy, and the enemy should walk into the mines while chasing you. If the enemy avoids the mines, use his Super or Last Hurrah Gadget to knock them back into the mines. You can also defend yourself at close range with his Super or Last Hurrah Gadget regularly, but you must use them carefully. For his Last Hurrah Gadget, you should position yourself when using it so enemies aren't knocked into a wall, because if they do, they can re-approach you. If you can't position yourself on a closed map, aim his attack at yourself to discourage repeated approach. Throw his Super in front of the enemy rather than throwing it behind the enemy to knock them away from you, therefore allowing you to escape.",
      "Do not launch all of Tick's mines at once. It's not ideal, as it leaves you defenseless and unable to block choke points due to his slow reload speed. Additionally, the potential damage is subpar compared to the area control your team gains",
      "In order to make his Super damage as effective as possible, place it as close to enemies as possible. This makes it almost impossible to destroy."
    ],
    "Other": [
      "Tick is very effective at control, which is amplified with his Mine Mania Gadget. Predict where enemies will head and throw your mines there instead of throwing your mines directly at them. This forces them back because if enemies walk into the mines, they'll take a huge amount of damage. Tick can hamper enemies from collecting vital items or heading into vital areas such as the Gem mine inGem Grab, Bolts inSiege, the blue star inBounty, or the zones inHot Zoneby throwing mines at the above items or areas.",
      "Tick's head can inflict high area damage that can also destroy obstacles and is capable of chasing Brawlers into closed areas. His head can be easily destroyed from a range however due to its low health and short range, so it's best to use it against low-health enemies to force them to attack the head and prevent them from healing or an enemy who has used up all ammo. He can also use his Super inBrawl Ballon enemy defenders near their goal, because the head can defeat them with its high area damage as well as break obstacles to help teammates score at ease.",
      "Tick's struggle in close-ranged combat makes him prone to being ambushed in bush areas. However, Tick also has an advantage in bush areas. His head can be used in bushes and it would detect and damage the nearest enemy while it would be unnoticeable. He can also throw his mines at narrow lanes so that enemies take damage, which reveals them and prevents them from sneaking up on you and your teammates.",
      "Tick can discourage enemies from using teleporters or launchpads by deploying his mines to the location where the enemy will end up, guaranteeing massive damage if not defeating them once they land or teleport. This is a viable strategy in some maps such asEnds MeetandGem Bash. If the enemies manage to survive, he can place extra mines in front of or behind of the teleporter/landing area depending on the enemies' movement."
