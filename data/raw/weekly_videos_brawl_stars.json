    "creator": "CryingMan",
    "transcript": "The 10 best brawler since season 38. The 10th best brawler right now is Lily. Yeah, Lily is finally in the meta. I mean, she's been pretty decent even before the hypercharge got released. But yeah, now she's easily top 10. Watch this do super. Okay, thank you for the free super. The good thing about Lily is that you can play Lily in any mode. You can play in Brawl Ball, bounty, knock out, like gem grab, doesn't matter. Um, just going to use my super cuz they use all the ammo and they're kind of low HP. Good super by Fang. I can just walk in. And you guys can see I already got my hypercharge. So like it's just so easy to get a hypercharge back. Now I can just use my gadget and just use my hypercharge. All right, that was not the best hypercharge, but uh yeah, at least the prem is kind of low. And now I'm going to be kind of useless until I get the super back or the gadget. So yeah, this is the only bad thing about Lily. Like you can't miss a super or the gadget. You're basically going to become an achar. Okay. All right. Pretty good defense by my team. I just got to get my super and just Yeah. Get a kill. Just so good, bro. Like, got to watch out the primo hypercharge. Just going to use my gadget just to make sure I stay alive. Good hypercharge by Aker. All right. Nobody saw that. But now I can score it with my hypercharge pack. Just so good. I definitely recommend you guys to max out. The ninth best brawler right now is Ali. Yeah, I'm going to play in duels cuz my aliies have like 200 trophies, but we're facing RT. Should be an easy matchup. I'm just going to go up, use my gadget and easy kill. I mean, Ali used to be like easily top three, but now she kind of I mean, he kind of got like fell off. Not because like Ali sucks, but now there's just so many better brawlers to play. Okay, so Gail got a super. So, what I can do now is just use my super and the gadget. Like this combo doesn't get countered unless you play like Poco or Frank. Nah, bro. Like, this got to be a rage bait. All good. Just going to get a super and yeah, there's just no way this guy can kill me. Just going to Yeah, use the super to the wall. And this guy can't really do anything, bro. Going to use my gadget just in case cuz I have an infinite gadget, too. And now we're facing Lily. This guy can't deal enough damage to kill me. So, I can just go up, take the shot. There's nothing this guy can do unless he has a hypercharge and like be the best Lily in the world. Okay. He's going to miss a gadget, too. I mean, the super. Uh, just let it go, bro. Like, you're not going to win. Is it going right or left, right, going left? He got a super, but I can just, you know, get close, bro. Let it go. Let it go, bro. Yeah, Ali is still really solid. Like, easily top three tank in the current meta. The eighth best brawler right now is Carl. Yeah, he's still a very solid brawler. You can't really go wrong with this pick. Um, okay. We hit the cold. Just going to use my gadget. The lobster should be dead. Okay, good pinch. I mean, you can't really first pick every single time cuz you can easily get countered by like Chester or some tanky brawlers, you know. Uh, I'm just going to put the ball and use my super. All right. See, like he's still very good. Got my hypercharge as well and the gadget. Just so much versatility, you know. Uh, now there's so many things I can do. Just got to watch out the kiss super. Going to use my gadget. Yeah, he should be dead. And now I can just use the super tank some shot. Like doesn't matter, bro. The hypercharge super is so good, bro. I literally carried. He's so good still. Yeah, he's still very decent. So, definitely consider maxing out. The seventh best brawler right now is Melody. Oh, by the way, huge shout out to second for, you know, helping me making the tier list. He told me to like put Kaz instead of Melody, but bro, like Kaz is not released. So yeah, melody is just so good. You can play in any mode. Definitely a high skill kit brawler. So you got to be good at the game to play this brawler. Let me see. Uh just going to use my gadget. Free kill. Now I can go for tech and this guy should be dead. Like look at this. Just so good if you know what to play. Uh but yeah, let me see. Just going to get my notes from the tester. Uh hopefully I can get a kill. Yep. Okay, so now we have one super left. H got to watch out the B super. Okay, this should be a free kill. Um, okay, we might get pinched. Relax, bro. Relax. Oh my god. Please, please. This guy really wanted to kill me, but now I got a hypercharge. I have only one super left, so I'm just going to use it. Um, yeah, this guy can kill me, bro. I know what you're doing, bro. Oh, okay. Goodbye. And now I'm going to hypercharge. Let me see. Okay, Primo is here. Like, let it go, bro. Mele is so good. I don't know why I'm playing in spinny mode, but free win. But yeah, definitely solid brawler, so consider mixing up. The sixth best brawler right now is Hank. Yeah, Hank is back in the meta. Like, so good. It's just so hard to counter him, bro. All you got to do is just regen, go up, tank some shot, and you can instantly deal like 4.2k 2k damage and once you get a super you can just heal up like watch this. Yeah, I think it's currently the best tank unless you like consider Kenji is the best tank. Like you just got to go up and they got to like retreat. You got to make sure you aim first and then use the hypercharge to get the maximum value now. Got to hit a shot. Use the super to regen like and now I just got to bait the terra super. I knew he was going to do that. And yeah, I know him says a gadget but doesn't matter. I have so much HP to get the he up in. I mean, you need to kind of practice to be a good Hank, but yeah, still just max out. The fifth best brawler right now is Mele. Yeah, another one of the new brawlers, so I have to play in duels cuz I don't push new brawlers. Uh, did I get him or no? I don't think so. Oh, wait. Okay, relax. Oh my god. All right. But yeah, me is so good. You can play in any mode. Like, just so easy to hit a shot. You can basically auto aim. Yeah, this should be a Okay, goodbye. You can play in any mode. You can play against the any matchup. Like, just so good. Oh my god. Okay, this is kind of cool interaction. Just look at this. Oh, look at this. All right. Um, got to watch the fing shot. Fin is lowkey good, too. I don't know if I got him or not. I don't think so. Um, okay. Nope. Just going to get a super and use my gadget. Uh, okay. Now I got a super back. Just got to wait for my gadget and this should be GG. Give me the gadget. Okay, now I can use the gadget. Oh my god, this is so toxic. Yeah, easily one of the best brawlers. So definitely consider maxing out. For number four, we got Cryman. N spent n Jong. I see so many comments where like people saying Jayong is spend LC and I know like seconds saying like Jayong is crying mean like kind of relax on us but look at this. Yeah, I told you in the Jayong video that he's going to be one of the best brawers. Like I think the most broken thing about Jayong is that you can basically get a permanent speed buff. Like every time you hit someone, not hit someone, every time you use the main attack like so stupid. I mean I love this brawler, bro. Not because like people saying Jong is basically crying man when he quits YouTube, but yeah, I'm going to just use my damage gadget. 2.3k is pretty slow, too. All right, goodbye. It's just so hard to like dodge a shot. Like his shot is impossible to dodge and like I don't know, man. Just so good. Definitely max out. The third best brother right now is Chester. I mean, yeah, you guys all know like he got nerfed or she got nerfed. I forgot his gender, her gender, but yeah, his hypercharge is just so good still. It's just it deals way too much damage. Dude, their comp is so weird. Like Jackie Pokemon max. That's going to be like 2022 comp. Uh we can look just do this. Oh my god, this Jackie got a super. Maybe I should have just walk in, but I think like Jackie knows how to like save the goal. Okay, good play by Mortis. All right, Rico is going to go down. I got a bomb super, so I'm just going to use the super on the Jackie and the Poco. Pretty good. And I got a super back. Uh, we can definitely defend, right? Keep the distance. All right. And now I got a hypercharge. I know Poco is here. All right. Just going to get a super back and we should be fine. Uh, going to use my hypercharge and get close. Going to use it on the Jackie. And I hit the max as well. That poison damage can do like 5k damage. It's kind of stupid, bro. But yeah, just walk in. Look at this mortise. All right, I got my bomb super back. So hopefully can defend this is yeah too much HP honestly. Uh I think we're cooked. There's just no way we can defend this rip. But you guys can see I almost got my hypercharge back. So we just got to defend and we should be good. Yeah, got my hypercharge and just go up. Tank some shot. The hypercharge. So broken. Yeah, I don't think Chester is going to get nerfed again. So highly recommend you guys to mix up. The second best brawler right now is Lumi. Yeah, another new brawler that I didn't even push. Like I don't really push like the trophies mode. You guys all know like she can deal insane amount of damage. Just so hard to like push against the Lumi. Like she has so much area control. This Leon is kind of slimy though. Uh bro, like are you going to wait for the smoke? All right, just got to wait for the gadget. And yeah, I don't know what this guy's doing honestly, but now we can just place the gadget. All right. Not the best gadget, but all good. Hopefully, bro. All good. We slow him down. Yeah. Goodbye. Hey, Lumi always gets banned at high rank. It's always like Lumi, like Kenji, sometimes Ali. Uh, yeah, he should be dead. Like, look at the damage. But yeah, low key like Daryl can counter me if he just used the super on me. But I don't think this guy's good at the game. Like, what are you doing, bro? Okay, we hit the Daryl again. Yeah, this guy's doesn't know what he's doing right now. Like, but yeah, definitely makes out. She's just insane. The best brother right now is this dog. Yeah, the reason why Kenji is so good right now, you guys all know he's hypercharged. Like, it just doesn't make sense, bro. I've never seen more broken hypercharge than this. Like, Supercell, you got to do something about this. Seriously, it's just so damn horrendous, bro. Uh, got to watch out the post super though. All right. Um, okay. Not looking too good. They might score. All right. He's going to use the super ripe, but you know what? It doesn't matter, actually. Like, I'm just going to use my hypercharge. Goodbye. Game over. Like, what are we doing? Supercell. Seriously, like, what are we doing? Like, this should never happen, bro. They got to nerf it before the the Brawl Cup or something. Unfortunately, they released the new hypercharges for Grief, Amber, and Willow right after I recorded. So, let me just share my thoughts really quick whether they're going to be in top 10 or not. All right, so first we got Amber. She's 100% going to be in top 10. She's insane. Her hypercharge has crazy team wide potential. She was already a decent brawler and now with the hypercharge, she's going to be like easily top five brawler. Next, we got Grief. Yeah, Grief is also going to be insane. He's going to be a complete aggro counter. His hypercharge has insane myite potential. Like, you just can't do anything against this. He also is a wall break gadget, so you can pretty much play him in any mode. Yeah, he's going to be at least in top 10 if not in top five. Lastly, we got Willow. I mean, Willow is okay, too, but I don't think she's a top 10 candidate. Her hypercharge isn't anything crazy, but you can still kind of use it in more aggressive way. Now, it's going to be kind of tricky to play any aggressive brawlers into Willow cuz I think Willow hypercharge can kind of counter the assassin to send any aggressive brawlers. So, we got to wait and see how she plays out. But for now, I'll probably put her in top 20. Anyways, I'm going to make a video about each hypercharge pretty soon, so stay tuned, subscribe. Thank you guys for all the support, and I'll see you guys pretty soon."

    "title": "*TIER LIST* DEL META DE BRAWL STARS DE MAYO",
    "creator": "Rol - Brawl Stars Competitivo",
    "transcript": "Si te gusta saber meta de Brawl Stars, tranquilo, porque voy a traerte la mejor tierlist de todo YouTube. ¿Y por qué es la mejor tierlist que vas a encontrar en todo YouTube? Pues bueno, para el que no me conozca, hola, yo soy Roll, soy entrenador profesional de Brawl Stars para Timer Etics y estoy entrenando y preparándome muchísimo los partidos que se están viniendo estos días. Ya sabéis que estos viendo a ver si se hace algún cambio, si no, bueno, está todo un poquito en el aire, pero llevamos entrenando muchísimo. Y para el que no me conozca de mi pasado, yo soy entrenador profesional de Brawl Stars. Vamos, desde que empezó el competitivo, llevo siendo profesional cuatro últimos años y he clasificado a los últimos cuatro mundiales, pero esto no empieza ahí. Llevo jugando desde hace mucho más y siendo entrenador mucho más en equipos más pequeños como Artic Gaming, Team Queso. Y bueno, también he pasado por equipos como Tribe Gaming, AC Milan Class, eh Food Esports y ahora estamos en Teamis. Así que bueno, sin hacernos más espera, vamos a ir con la tierlist. Empezamos con los brawlers especiales, super especiales, épicos, míticos, legendarios y así avanzando hasta el final. Y dado si queréis encontrar algún problema exacto, solamente tenéis que saber su rareza e ir directamente a esa parte del vídeo. Así que empezamos. Vale, chicos, si queréis una aproximación de cómo va a ser esto, digamos que en ese van a estar los brawlers más rotos, los que están más fuertes del meta y que probablemente tenáis que mejorar en A. los siguientes que también está muy fuerte, pero no están tan rotos como para ser FPC siempre, ya me entendéis, ¿no? Como que está muy muy bien el meta, pero tampoco tanto. En B y en C estarán los brawlers que están normal en el meta, ni arriba ni abajo. Se pueden jugar depende de la situación y puede ser que tengan unos problemers mejores que ellos mismos en ese o en A. Y en D y E los brablers que no debería jugar y en E, los que son injugables prácticamente o que no se ven apenas en situaciones. Así que bueno, vamos a empezar. Ya sabéis que voy a dedicar una dos frases a cada brawler más o menos para que tengáis una idea aproximada de cómo está en el meta. Vale, empezamos con Sell primer brawler, brawler que todo el mundo tiene nada más desbloquear el juego y por desgracia se va a ir a tier F. Hay muchos, es un antitanque que debería parar tanques y sin embarco estamos dando cuenta en el meta que hay muchos tanques que pueden ganar la es una locura pero es real, así que el que se va a ir a tier F, no hace suición de antitanque a la perfección hay mejores problemas, así que se va a quedar ahí. Nita, buen antitanque. Esto sí es un buen ejemplo antitanque, no de los mejores del meta, pero sí que está bastante bien en ciertos mapas, así que yo la voy a poner directamente en cierpe sin ningún miedo. Me parece que está siendo bastante buena en ciertas situaciones. La hace counter no solo a brawlers eh tanques, sino también le hace counters a otros brawlers como Tara. Eh, cuando pone el oso hay muchos brawlers que lo pasan muy muy mal. Así que esta Nita que sair a TRB Colt no se está viendo mucho, pero sí que hay muchos papás de he de lo mejor que puedes piquear, así que lo voy a poner en tier C. No es muy muy bueno, pero tampoco es muy muy malo. Lo dejamos en tierce que ahí está perfectamente Bull, uno de los peores tanques del juego. Probablemente no tiene lo que viene siendo una manera de aguantar vivo, así que lo vamos a dejar en tierte. Lo dejamos ahí y que no salga. Vale, chicos, pasamos a tier, eh, perdón, pasamos a Brock, que se va a meter con Colt. Se ve en alguna situación o bueno, puede que no, eh. Creo que Brock lo voy a mandar incluso a Tierde con Bull. Le falta algo, ¿no creéis que no se está viendo apenas nada? Le hace counter muchísimo brawlers, eh, snipers también los tanques, velocidades como max. Lo vamos a dejar en tier D, no lo estoy viendo absolutamente nada. El primo tier C brawler bastante decente para hacer counter a otro tanques, perdón, pero no está entre lo más jugado. Barley. Barley quizás sea el primer brawler que va a mover a tier A. Eh, me parece un brawler con hipercarga muy muy bueno. Se ve muchos mapas y puede hacerle counter a muchísimos brawlers. También hace counter algunos throwers como puede ser Berry para fidearse muchísimo y cargar muchísimas ultiscargas. La voy a dejar ahí en tier a poco otro brother que se va tier A. Se ve bastante, te cambia el meta, ¿eh? Bueno, quizás está entre tiera y tier B, quizás no llega tanto a tiera. Lo vamos a dejar en tier B. Creo que es un que no se ve tanto como para ponerlo en tiera, pero sí que es muy bueno en muchos mapas, así que de momento lo dejamos ahí. Rosa brawler bastante malillo. Creo que lo voy a dejar en tier D. Creo que no lo voy a subir a C de momento. Se puede ver, sí se puede ver. Para mí no es el mejor player del mundo y creo que le ayuda mucho es el poder poner tantos arbustos, pero hay tantos antidankers y tiene una manera tan difícil de acercarse al rival es que por lo menos el pivo puede saltar. Bull incluso puede ir en línea recta, pero es que Rosa no tiene nada para acercarse, así que de momento le voy a poner en tierde. Pasamos con Jessie que se está viendo algo, pero tampoco mucho le voy a poner en tierc. Se va a ver. Sí, pero tampoco una locura. Le percarga todavía no sigue, no termina de destacar. De momento lo vamos a dejar en tierce. Dynamike a tierce también se puede ver, sí, pero no es el mejor thrower ni de coña. Se queda un poquito atrás, así que de momento lo ponemos ahí. Tic, lo vamos a subir a tier B. Es un brawler asequible, se puede jugar, no está tan mal, pero situaciones muy exactas y sobre todo en bounty y en y enqueo se ve bastante, por eso lo voy a subir un poquito más. 8 bit lo vamos a dejar en tier C o tier B, no va a ser C, en plan, se puede ver en situaciones muy exactas, pero solo lo estamos viendo en gemas, ya ni siquiera lo estamos viendo en mapas de he, así que se va a quedar ahí rico tier B antitanque bastante bueno siempre y cuando tengas el mapa y el momento donde jugarlo, también la habilidad personaje con bastante habilidad y que no todo el mundo puede jugarlo, eh, se puede complicar un poco. Darril, un buen tanque. Ahora sí que sí lo vamos a dejar en tier B. Se puede ver, está bastante bien, pero es cierto que hay mucha gente que no lo termina de jugar, así que de momento tier B no lo vas a subir mucho más. Penny, uf, Penny, tengo mis dudas, eh, lo había estado pensando antes, no sé si apuntado algo. Creo que le voy a dejar en tierce, no termina de estar tan bien. Le han bajado bastante m el mortero, tal, no sé, no lo termino de ver. De momento lo vamos a dejar en tier C, pero lo podrías subir un poquito a tier B. Carl, indiscutible. Tier A, muy muy buen brawler. a pesar de los nerfeos que está recibiendo, sigue siendo lo mejor que puede jugar en el meta. Jacki, ojo porque Jacki sube bastante, no solo por Jacki Casket, sino también por el buff a ciertos brawlers que la deja eh muy alta. Por ejemplo, es un brawler que hace counter a brawlers meta como Kenji, como Sade, por lo tanto ha subido bastante, estaría entre A y B, eh, tendría que pensármelo bastante. También le hace Counter Bter, es que es un brawler muy meta, chicos. Creo que lo voy a poner en A. Eh, estaba dudando si ponerla en B o en A, pero al ver que es un brawler que está baneando todo el mundo, porque si quieres piquear Baster, Sate o Kenji, es un brawler que tienes que banear sí o sí, entonces lo voy a dejar entiera mucho ojo. Está Yai que viene fuerte, pero es verdad que también se puede bajar a eh un poquito ya cada uno decisión de cada uno. Yo de momento lo voy a poner aquí Gus y y tiera o tier, ¿qué decís vosotros? Yo lo voy a poner en tier B. La hipercarga me pensaba que iba a ser mucho mejor, pero la verdad es que no hace nada, no cambia la partida como otras hipercargas. Lo dejo en TierP, sigue estando decente en ciertos mapas, pero no es lo mejor que vais a encontrar. Bo, Bo, que se va directo al tier A. Brawler con rango, brawler con daño, me gusta bastante. De momento lo vamos a dejar aquí muy muy top. Eh, MZ eh pensando eh pensando pensamientos, la voy a dejar en tier D o C. Es que no le estoy viendo nada. No lo he visto ni una vez en competitivo desde que empezó el año. Le falta algo, no sé qué es, pero algo le falta. Lo voy a dejar en cierte. Bueno, sí se ha visto en Latinoamérica, pero en Europa yo personalmente ningún entreno ni nada, así que lo voy a dejar ahí. ST puede ser que siga en tier A, puede ser que lo podamos bajar incluso a tier B. Yo de momento lo dejo en Tier A. Eh, sigue estando bastante okay y se es un brawler muy muy completo. Eh, Piper que se va a ir a tier. Sí, Tiera o Tier Tier A, ¿no? ¿Qué tipo otro? Yo es que no sé si tiera o tier B está quizás no es de lo mejor. Vamos a decir que en tier S están los mejores br del meta, ¿no? Lo que es indiscutiblemente bueno y en tiera que se pueden jugar en casi todos los mapas. Mirad como esto lo podemos jugar en casi todo, pero es verdad que Piper no se puede jugar en todos los mapas, solamente en bounty tal, noqueo, alguno de he vas a dejar en B. Está muy bien el meta, pero no está entre lo mejor. Pam, que ha subido bastante. Le voy a dejar en tier A. La estoy viendo muy muy fuerte. La estoy viendo de lo mejor que hay. Y quizás sí que la ponga en el tier A. Sí, lo vamos a dejar ahí porque se está moviendo bastante. Frank, lo vamos a poner en tier C. No es de lo mejor, pero sí es verdad que se va a tirar ciertos tanques meta también. Entonces, bueno, tías de justicia. Vivi, Bibi, no la termino de ver, la vamos a dejar en tier D. No termina de encajar. Yo de momento le voy a poner aquí, incluso voy a hacer una modificación, chicos, y voy a mover a Bull a TRF, chicos. Creo que va a haber muy poco probable en TRF. Al final creo que BR está haciendo un buen intento en subir los probes bajos y cada vez están más igualados. De momento lo vamos a dejar en tier Full y está vive en tier D. Bea podría estar perfectamente en tier S, me parece a mí, ¿eh? Pero la vamos a bajar a tiera. Creo que se puede ver en tier S. Es un brawler muy completo, muchas veces en FPCK indiscutible y baneo. Entonces, lo vamos a dejar este tier A, pero podría ser perfectamente un tier eh eh de los mejores antitanques que podemos ver debido a la cantidad de mapas abiertos que hay. Nani no termina de estar bien. Se ve muy poco. Vamos a dejar el tier Clemente para hacer counter a ciertos brawlers. No me encaja, no me encaja, oye. No, no deía que encajarme. Edgar, pues Edgar no está mal, ¿eh? Estaría entre B y C. Lo voy a dejar en C, pero ojo, porque se puede llegar a ver más, ¿eh? Hubo un tiempo en que Edgar estaba tiers, chicos, o Tier Globus y la gente no se lo creía, pero sí, Edgar que sale del pozo, se queda en tier C. Griff, muy bien y cada vez mejor debido a esta hipercarga que le van a poner. Creo que lo voy a poner incluso en tier B. Lo veo un poquito mejor que los jugador que los probable de tier C. Está ahí, ahí lo vamos a dejar aquí. Creo que se puede ver bastantes mapas y cuando le meta el piccar que va a subir un montón. Grom lo vamos a dejar en tier C. No es el mejor thrower, pero si tienes habilidad con él puede cambiar la partida. Está claro. Bonnie, Bonnie se está viendo bastante ahora. El bufado, lo voy a dejar en tier B. Ahora se ve en Hair, se puede ver en bounty, incluso en noqueo en algún mapilla. Lo veo bastante asequible. La vamos a dejar en tier B. Los eh main bonnie que pueden sonreír porque la verdad que está bastante fuerte. Gale se va a ir a tier B, quizás sea el mejor full antitanque. Si tiene delante muchos antitanques, lo podría bajar a C, pero bueno, yo lo voy a dejar en tier B. Colet bastante regulera, no se está viendo que si nada, hay bastante counter, lo voy a dejar de momento en tier C, pero podríamos ponerlo en tier B perfect y en tier D incluso. Puede que también. Bell muy completo. Lo vamos a dejar en tier A. Lo veo muy muy top y cada vez se ve de más as podría estar en A, pero lo voy a dejar en B. Creo que hay muchos antitanques en este met, pero ojo porque podríamos subirlo perfectamente a tierra. Yo de momento lo voy a dejar en tier B. Lola, Lola no está mal. Podríamos dejarlo en tier C. Empezamos a abrir ya el doble reglón en tier C. No la termino de ver. Le falta algo, no sé, como que algo todavía me falta para esta Lola. Sam, muy mal. La gent F. Pensábamos que leer carga iba a cambiar el meta, no lo hizo y de hecho se quedó bastante estancado. Lo vamos a dejar a Sama ahí en ese tier F. Mandy, Mandy no está nada mal, ¿eh? Creo que le voy a poner en tier C o D. Creo que le voy a poner en B. En C, perdón. No se está viendo tanto. No está mal. La hipercarga de hecho Bounty es de lo mejor que puedes tener y si eres buenam mandandy, puedes carrilear la partida entera, pero yo le voy a ver en tier C. Recordemos que tier B y tier C son como los brawlers más igualados, los que están bien de meta y no tienen que estar ni muy arriba ni muy abajo. Así que es un brawler que lo veo bien, no creo que haya que nerfearla ni bufarla. Está bien ahí. Quita un pequeño buff, pero muy muy pequeño. Me cada vez me gusta más. Incluso lo voy a poner en tier B. Creo que es un antitanque muy completo, de los pocos antitanques que puede parar a como Jacki, así que se va a quedar ahí. Hank, Hank de mi vida. Perdonad, perdonad por esto que voy a hacer, pero lo voy a poner en tieres. Me parece de los mejores probes que hay ahora mismo, eh, muy completo, difícil de conterear, eh, se ven todos los mapas. Hank es nuestro primer tier S porque está bastante completo. Pe que se va a ir a tier C. Ni fu ni fa se puede ver en algunos mapas, pero tampoco es lo mejor. Larry, Lauri, tier B me parecen completos, no son los mejores throwers, pero lo vamos a dejar en tier B. Y ojo porque empezamos a meternos en los braules ya más interesantes. Angelo, segundo brawler en su vida TS muy muy bueno, el mejor sniper posible hace counter incluso a Throwes porque puede atravesar y de un disparo con ulti puede cargarse a muchos. Así que este Angel se queda en tier S. Berry, muy buen brawler, lo vamos a dejar en tier A, se está viendo cada vez más y, incluso se podría bajar a tier B, pero creo que está bastante bien ahí, me gusta mucho y creo que da para hacer muchísimas estrategias, así que lo vamos a dejar en tier A. Sade, entre tier A y tier B. Hm, creo que le dejar en Tierb simplemente porque hay momentos en los que es muy difícil que este rol se meta en ciertos mapas por la cantidad de mapas abiertos que hay. Así que lo vamos a dejar en Tier B, pero está muy muy bien. Si sabéis jugarlo está genial. MEL estaría entre tier S y tier A. Lo voy a dejar en tier A. Creo que no llega a ser tan tiers. No llega a ser para tanto, pero lo vamos a poner ahí. Mortis lo estoy viendo cada vez mejor, ¿eh? Lo vamos a dejar en tier B. No llega a ser de A, pero casi. Eh, lo veo muy muy top. Creo que puede dar la vuelta a muchas partidas y un buen Mortis ahora mismo puede carrilear el meta. Tara que le vamos a poner en tiera. Me parece muy buen brawler, muy buen antitanques ahora que hay muchos tanques y, incluso en gemas la veo un pck casi obligatorio, incluso casi de fest pick la veo muy top, me está gustando mucho esta tarara, cada vez más es lo que estoy viendo en trenos y es un predict mío. Realmente estaría por ti en BC, pero os digo que provéis tratar en gemas porque creo que simplemente cargarle percarga y en último segundo ir a la base del rival y robarle las gemas es una locura. Así que le vamos a poner este tier A, genio también en tieras. Bueno, tier A o tier B, lo voy a poner en tier A porque creo que en mapas como Bounty, como Gema, Bounty y Noko, es lo mejor que has visto este genio en tu vida. Pero además se puede jugar en gemas, en algunos mapas abiertos de Brawl Ball se puede llegar a ver, lo vas a dejar ahí, Max, tier o tier A, eh, creo que lo voy a dejar en tier A. Está ahí, ahí lo vamos a dejar ahí porque creo que no termina de ser pues fesp en todos los mapas, ¿no? Pero podría ser de los muy altos de Topa, casi entrando en tier S. Mr. P no lo termino de ver, lo vamos a dejar en tier C. Se puede ver en algún momento, pero tampoco no. No sé la demás gente cómo lo pondrá, pero yo lo voy a poner en tierce. No, no lo termino de ver. Sprout tierce también no llega a ser el mejor thrower. Lo veo un poquito fuerita del meta. Byron. Byron está bastante bien. Lo voy a poner en tiera. A o B. A o B. Lo voy a poner en tier B. Creo que est poniendo problem en tiera. Es un problema es muy muy bueno. Podría estar en tiera perfectamente, pero para mí que le falta un poquito más todavía. Squck tier B perfectamente y bien verecido. Muy muy bueno. Low antitanque, por lo tanto se va casi directo al tier. Muy muy bien. Se está viendo bastante poco le hace bastante counter, pero este low creo que está bastante bastante bien. Es que no sé si o B, eh, quizás lo voy a mover a B. Creo que a tiene que ser solamente los que se ve en todos los mapas. Se ve en todos los mapas. Bueno, en casi todos sí, eh. Eh, cuestión de gustos, lo podéis mover a A, lo podéis mover a B, como vosotros queráis. Roofs, lo voy a poner en tier C. Se ve en ciertos mapas, pero muy muy indicados. Buff, tier B se está viendo bastante para conterar. Ciertos brawlers. Fang, lo siento, chicos, sé que no sé que os gusta mucho y sé que pensáis que está rotísimo, pero la verdad es que no. La verdad es que se quedó un poquito inútil. Lo voy a dejar en tier D. Ibi, muy buen Brawler. Lo voy a mover a tier B. No creo que llegue a estar en tier, pero ahí Janet lo vas a mover a tier. Eh, sigue siendo bastante buena, ¿eh? Bueno, incluso la podíamos bajar a tier B, ¿no? Ahí, ahí. Lo voy a dejar en tier A porque creo que puede estar bastante roto y puede ser de los mejores en ciertos mapas, pero ahí OT se lo vas a mover a tier B. Se puede ver algo, pero tampoco se está viendo mucho. Baster, tiera, indiscutible, muy brawler, probablemente de los mejores tanques del juego. Grey también. Tiera muy muy top. Eh, se está viendo mucho mapa de gemas, mucho mapa de noqueo. Casi que se podría subir a ese, pero lo voy a dejar en A porque ahí hay ahí. Eh, RT tier B perfectamente de los mejores brawlers que hay así de larga distancia. Además, antitan, ya lo veo muy muy bien. Willow se va a ir a tier Casi D. Eh, lo voy a poner en tier D, incluso creo que se puede jugar en Cones muy muy exactas de Brawl Ball, pero ya está, no se ve en nada más. D está mal, creo que cada vez se va a ver más. Lo voy a poner en tier D, pero casi que lo pongo en C. Lo voy a poner en tier D porque aún tenemos que probarlo y muchos equipos no se atreven a jugarlo. De momento se va a quedar en este tier D. Chuck. Me parece un brawler indiscutible para un mapa de Hase. Es de lo mejor que te puedes encontrar en Heista lo voy a poner en C porque solo se puede ver en He, pero digo de verdad que en he mejor brawler que puedes ver. De verdad, a lo mejor le estoy haciendo mala justicia y habrá que subirlo a B. La verdad que un buffa chak no lo queremos. Vamos a dejarlo en en Ah, no en tierce enerce en tierce. Está bien, no queremos un buff a este brawler y está bastante asequible. Charlie en cierto momento está bien. Le voy a poner en tier C. Miko ha subido bastante en el metal. La vamos a poner en tier B, chicos. Mico hace una cantidad de daño a caja muy grande. Eh, también se puede ver como asesino, mapas de bounty, noqueo, eh, se ve bastante. Lo vamos a poner en este tier B porque está bastante bastante bien. Melody se ve algo. Lo voy a hacer en Tier B. Tampoco es de lo mejor mejor, pero bueno, pues ahí está. Se está viendo bastante, ¿eh? Lili, sí, la voy a subir a ver. La hipercarga le da un pequeño buff tampoco muy grande. Quizá debería que ponerla en tier C. Voy a ponerla de momento en tier C. Bueno, vamos a ver qué tal funciona y ya veremos qué tal. Clan no lo termino de ver. Estaría en tier C o en tier D. Lo voy a poner en tier D. Creo que no es el mejor antitanque ni mucho menos, así que lo vamos a dejar por ahí en medio. Mou que se va a tier B perfectamente. La verdad que sigue estando muy bien. Yu es S o a eh o A. Eh, vamos a dejarlo en A. En A. La verdad que no termina ser de los mejores. Oli sigue siendo un tier. A sigue estando muy muy top. Finx también se va a tier. Muy bueno Lumi. Siguiente BR que entra en Tiers y de los últimos ya muy muy bien esta Lumi se está viendo bastante y sigue siendo a pesar del nerf bastante bastante buena. Y ojo porque a lo mejor me va a faltar espacio por aquí, ¿eh? Veo que está la que tiene un poquito ajustada. Spike lo vamos a dejar en tierce. No es el mejor antitanque tampoco está muy allá. Bueno, sin más. Crow, que también se va a tier C. León también se va a ir al Tier C, así que vamos a hacer un pequeño parón para reajustar la tabla. Vale, chicos, seguimos. León que se va a ir a Tier C. Se puede ver algo, pero tampoco es de lo mejor. Se queda ahí de momento. No lo termino de ver entre los mejores brawlers, la verdad. Sandy entre C y B también. Lo voy a dejar en tier C. Está bastante bien, pero sé más. Amber sube a Tiera, me parece de los mejores brawlers que podemos ver ahora mismo. Lo vamos a dejar en Tiera y creo que se va a ver bastante. Meg, bueno, está bien. Nifuá entre C y D creo que la voy a dejar en C. Creo que no termina de estar tan tan fuerte como muchos pensamos. Surch también se va al tier C. A veces se ataca mucho a la partida y no puede avanzar y se sufre bastante. Chester que se va a ir a tier ese de los mejores brawlers del meta. Muy muy top este Chester. Está bastante bastante bien. Cordilius. Cordilius que se va a ir a tier C. Se ven situaciones exactas. No termina de estar con los del A. Lo con los del B dejar en tier C. Kit que se va a tier A, sigue siendo lo mejor, sigue estando muy muy bien. Draco que lo vamos a dejar en tier B, no está entre los mejores, pero bastante seguible. Kenji que se va a tier S y Ja que se va a tir Kenji en Tier S. Simplemente por lo bien que está eh superc. La verdad que da, voy a hacer un poquito la tierlist así para que la veáis mejor. La verdad que es un brawler muy muy potente. Tiene una hipercarga que la cambia entera todo, cambia todo el juego entero. De repente todos los bos para Kenji está muy muy bien. ¿Y por qué Jaon arriba si no tiene daño rolls y tal? Lo que he visto competitivo, lo que os puedo decir es que va a ser casi siempre fespiqueado o baneado. Es lo que estoy viendo. Creo que es muy completo. Es como un Maxi un poco en el mismo equipo. Me parece una locura. Y el counter principal es crow, yo diría, por el anti el slow, el anticura, la verdad que le haría bastante counter, pero yo no me quería poner en ese. Es una predicción y ya veremos a ver qué tal me sale. Faltaría un poquito el brawler nuevo KCE, que todavía no ha salido cuando estoy grabando este vídeo, así que no sabían cómo ponerlo. Supongo que saldrá en ese porque si es un brawler ultra legendario, pues algo lo será. Así que bueno chicos, hagamos un pequeño resumen. Tier los mejores pelos del meta, los que la gente vanía para ellos están superb y siempre que estén deberíis piquearlos y deberíais subirlos si podéis. Ahí lo estáis viendo. Tier A, personajes que están muy bien en el meta, pero que no es de lo mejor, pero se ven en casi todos los mapas. Tier B, brawlers que están bien en el meta y en la situación exacta te puede cambiar la partida, así que están muy bien. Tier C, personajes que están ahí ahí en el meta, no están muy mal y la situación perfecta se pueden jugar, pero tampoco te van a cambiar mucho la partida. tier de personajes, no recomiendo jugar, pero que en momentos exactos, pues oye, puede que no vayan mal, pero no llegan a estar ahí y TRF no los piquéis porque hay mejores que ellos seguro, seguro, seguro. Así que nada más, chicos, este ha sido el vídeo. Si os ha servido, suscribiros al canal porque de verdad que se aprecia un montón las suscripciones. Y nada más, chicos. Espero que os haya ayudado este vídeo."

    "creator": "KairosTime Gaming",
    "transcript": "version 45 of the competitive Brawl Stars tier list. It's here. It's now. You guys know the deal here. We're going to rank every brawler from worst to best and compare them to how they were in the previous update. And this video was made in help or coordination with all of these pro players here. I did not make this tier list. I had zero input in this tier list, which you will see when we get to Griff when I adamantly disagree with the pros. But in the end, I know they're better than me. But this tier list does come with a massive disclaimer. Okay, this update, Supercell did something a little bit weird with Hypercharge releases, and they decided to release one the first week, three or three or four the next week, and they're just releasing them slower than I normally would expect. So, in order for me to get you this tier list and for it to be like as accurate as possible, I would have had to have waited for like 4 weeks for the pros to actually like really decide where the meta is. You guys don't want to wait 4 weeks. So, a lot of the hypercharges have not been included in consideration for this video. So, keep that in mind because it's not like I talked to the pros yesterday. It takes a long time to gather all our feedback and put it together. So anyway, let's get into this. Doug is kicking us off at the bottom of the F tier. Worst of the worst, bottom of the bunch. Sorry. Um, anyway, he didn't receive any changes this update. He is still the worst brawler in the game. We've got more to cover, but I want to give a huge thank you to repeat.gg for sponsoring today's video. And this is actually like legit. Like, this is a good one. I mean, all my sponsors are great ones, but this has specifically to do with Brawl Stars.

Start signing up for some tournaments, especially the Tribe Gaming Cup because it is going to be awesome. Once again, huge thank you to Repeat.gg GG for sponsoring this video. Bull has moved from the Dtier down into the F tier. The overall tank meta is a little bit weaker than before, but Bull was definitely one of the tanks that was hurt a lot from the meta shift. Now, there's just really not a good reason to play him. Clansancy is moving from the Ctier down into the F tier. Clansancy is one of the brawlers who is probably way better than what he's currently ranked at because his hypercharge is going to be released. Without it, though, it is unplayable or he's unplayable. So, just keep him in mind though once the Oh, wait. Hypercharge is already out by the time I'm actually recording this, but the pros haven't had time to actually decide placement. So anyway, Rosa's moving from the B tier down into the F tier. Similar to Bull, no changes were made to Rosa, but she was hurt a lot more than any other tank in the game by how the meta has changed. Time for the Dtier. These brawlers suck still, just not as much as the Ftier brawlers. Oh my gosh, Jesse's moved from the Ctier down to the Dtier. She actually receives a small buff to her health, but she still has very underwhelming damage. There just isn't a good reason to use her over many other brawlers. Even in heist, if all the meta brawlers are banned, then yeah, you could probably play Jesse. Not at the most competitive level, though. Edgar is staying in the D tier. Lots of brawlers were affected by emergency balance changes that shortly came out after gadget the gadgets were reworked, and Edgar's gadgets were both nerfed, so he's actually slightly worse than he was before. Chuck has moved from the Ctier down into the D tier. Even though Chuck is actually still really good in heist after the rework, there's basically no other use for him right now. I see some people try and make him work out in hot zone. Honestly, even there there are just better options. Colt has moved from the Ctier down into the Dtier. He didn't receive any buffs and just like Jesse, he is getting power crept every update as well. Fang is moving from the C tier down into the D tier. Too many of Fang's counters are higher up in the meta right now and there are several assassins to use that are just much better than him at the moment. BB is moving from the Ctier down to the Dtier. BB is just another close-range brawler that is particularly struggling right now and did not get any buffs this update. Sam is moving from the Ctier down to the D tier. I guess Sam's hypercharge really was overrated because as soon as it was released, he he hasn't been used like hardly at all. Shel's moving from the C tier down to the D tier. Since tanks aren't being used quite as much right now, Shelly is also being used less since she's really only good for countering them. Okay, now we have the Ctier brawlers. These ones aren't quite competitive. There may be some very small situations where the pros might use them, but they're not played nearly as often as the rest of the brawlers in the game. Dynamite has moved from the B tier down into the C tier. Dude, I'm getting hit so hard this update. My skin locked account, like almost all of my brawlers are C tier and below. It's rough. Lots of throwers are actually hurting in this meta because a lot of the more aggressive brawlers are at the top of the meta and Dynamite is probably like the hardest shot to land out of all of them, especially against fastoving targets. So, he's struggling. Lily is staying in the C tier. She's another brawler who's getting a hypercharge and so she might be a lot better than she like was, but for now she is a below average assassin. Gail is staying in the C tier. Very similar to Shel. There's not a huge need for Gail right now since tanks aren't being used as much. So, he's in the C tier. Griff is moving from the A tier down into the C tier. H, you know, and like I disagree with the pros, but at the same time, I am really feeling it. Griff has been affected by the meta has changed in a big way, but he is also getting a hypercharge, which I think is one of the better ones this update. I can almost guarantee he's going to rank a lot higher than like middle or low C tier, but if it's I don't know if it's going to bring him all the way back up to the A tier. We'll have to see. I still like Griff, which is funny because when he released, I really didn't like him. There's just something about his play style I just really like. Nani is staying in the C tier. Nani deals plenty of damage, but her shots are just really, really hard to land, especially against a lot of the top brawlers that have high mobility. El Primo was moving from the Btier down into the C tier. He didn't receive any balance changes, but there are much better options for closerange brawlers right now. Draco, hey, is moving down to the C tier. Hey, Draco plays particularly well with certain support brawlers, and even those brawlers aren't quite as good as before. So, Draco is being used even less. Serge has moved from the A tier down into the C tier. I have no issues with this. I hate playing against Serge. Serge was another really good brawler in like to play against close-range brawlers, but because closerange brawlers are being used less, he is really struggling up like to keep up with them. So, I mean, I'm fine with less surge for real. Rust has moved from the B tier down into the C tier. Russ is very dependent on what which other brawlers are actually being good and a lot of the brawlers that he typically is paired well with aren't being played at the moment. And additionally, the map pool right now doesn't really favor his bounce shots. So, there's not a lot of good reasons to use him right now. Brock has moved from the B tier down to the Ctier. Brock's biggest weakness is how easy his shots are to dodge against high mobility brawlers, and this meta is particularly bad for him. Eve is moving from the Btier down to the C tier. Eve is only really good against certain brawlers, and there are lots of decent brawlers that can pierce through her hatchlings, so she's just not as good as other longrange brawlers are. Miko is staying in the C tier. Miko received a small buff to his reload speed, but it hasn't really changed the way that he's being played at all. So, he's in the C tier still. Grom is staying in the C tier. Grom is the second thrower on our list whose attacks are relatively easy to dodge, so he's struggling in this meta even despite recently gaining a hypercharge. Sprout has moved from the A tier down into the C tier. Sprout's attacks actually can be hard to avoid, but it really depends on the map, and the current map pool just isn't very good for bounce shots, so Sprout struggles. M is staying in this C tier. I lost the F tier, just a sec. M is actually slightly better than before, but still doesn't play well against brawlers that can easily get close to her. So, she's struggling. And now we have the Btier brawlers. These brawlers are actually competitive. They're typically only good in the right maps or modes with the right teammates or to counter specific brawlers or they're just like generally good enough to play. They're not as good as the A tier or S tier brawlers at the moment though. Starting us off, we have Penny moving from the A tier down to the B tier. Penny is a pretty map dependent brawler and there aren't many maps and matchups where she can easily protect her cannon. So, she's not a top brawler for the moment. Nita is moving from the A tier down to the B tier. Nidita was a really good choice against a lot of like good tanks last update, but now they're being used a lot less and Nidita is as well. Otis is staying in the B tier. He actually was never a really like a great brawler except for when he was first released, but because of his range, his damage, and his super, he's never like a bad brawler. Sandy is staying in the B tier. Sy's super is strong enough to make him at least an average brawler, but his damage output isn't quite enough to keep up with the current meta. Leon is staying in the B tier. Leon's actually really good, but only if he is against brawlers that don't have attacks that can easily reveal his location or brawlers that have enough health that they cannot be assassinated quickly. Colette is moving from the A tier down to the B tier. She's just another great tank counter that has gone down an entire tier simply because of those tanks not being played as much. RT is staying in the B tier. Very similar to Otis. RT has the stats to always be a decently safe choice on almost any map, but doesn't really dominate any aspect or individual aspect of the game. Maisie is moving from the A tier down to the B tier. She's actually still a decent brawler, but she's also a great counter to close-range brawlers, which aren't as powerful right now. 8bit's moving from the A tier down to the B tier. 8bit is only good on certain maps and only with certain brawlers on his team. And while he was really good last update, he's being used a lot less right now. Byron is staying in the B tier. Many of the brawlers that Byron was being used to support have fallen down in the meta and so Byron consequently has also fallen down a little bit. Pearl is staying in the Btier. No changes were made to Pearl this update. She's exactly where she was in the last update. Spike is staying in the B tier. Spike also didn't receive any balance changes this update and he's honestly being used slightly less than before despite being one of the free brawlers to play every uh or you know well anyway the free brawler really doesn't impact the competitive meta like at all. So it doesn't really matter. Charlie is moving from the D tier up into the B tier. Charlie actually had a pretty big buff in the update before this one. And while she's not broken like she used to be. Uh she's actually being played quite a bit now. Buzz is staying in the B tier despite many of the close-range brawlers struggling in this meta. Buzz is actually still a pretty solid assassin. Cordelius is staying in the B tier. Cordelius actually didn't receive any balance changes, but this current map pool is just a just favors him a little bit better. So, I mean, still Btier, but a little bit better. Tick is staying in the B tier. Even though Tick is the most fragile brawler in the game, he's usually a decent thrower just because of how well he can deal damage with close-range brawlers as a thrower and also how consistently he can deal damage from a distance. Willow is moving from the Ctier up into the B tier. Willow received a buff to her health and she's receiving her hypercharge soon, so she's probably going to be even stronger than she is right now. Larry and Larry are moving from the A tier down into the B tier. Very similar to Tick. Larry is a solid thrower because he's actually pretty good against close-range brawlers, but Guju kind of just does everything that he can except better. So, Larry and Li is not being played as much. Jackie is maybe from the C tier up into the B tier. Somehow, Jackie is actually being playing being played more in this meta. And a lot of it has to do with how many of the maps she's really good on are in the current map pool for ranked. Crow is staying in the B tier. Crow receives a buff to the anti-healing effect from his attacks. And while he is definitely stronger than before, he's still not quite an A tier brawler. Terra is staying in the B tier. Nothing changed for Terara. She's basically just as good as she was in the last update. Poco is moving from the S tier down into the B tier. Poco is just insane right after the gadget rework happened. So now that the cooldowns are longer, he's not nearly as good. Mandy is moving from the A tier down into the B tier. Mandy received a slight nerf to her hypercharge rate, but actually brought her down an entire tier now that she's not charging it as much, which I have no issues with because I really don't like playing against Mandy. Piper is staying in the B tier. Piper's all she's probably always going to be a really solid sharpshooter. But in this meta, sharpshooters are struggling to hit shots at max distance, so Piper's not as good as she usually is. Belle is staying in the B tier. Basically, the same thing can be said about Belle, except that she deals more damage at close range, so than Piper does. So, she's actually slightly more usable than Piper, but not by much. Shade is moving from the C tier up into the B tier. Shade is pretty much useless on maps that don't have a ton of walls, but there seem to be a lot of maps with a lot of walls right now, so he's actually being played a lot. Mortise is staying in the B tier. Mortise didn't receive any balance changes, but he is being played just slightly more than before. Daryl's moving from the A tier down to the B tier. Daryl is a great assassin in a lot of situations, but like most tanks, he's getting countered more often in this update. So, not quite as good as before, but still playable. Mo is moving from the D tier up into the B tier. Mo actually got a buff to his reload speed in the update before this one. And then his super got reworked, so he's actually playable now. Kind of funny how just being able to adjust the distance of your super actually makes a big difference for a brawler like Mo. Gus has moved from the A tier down into the B tier. Gus has had a few nerfs in the last few updates, but he's one of the brawlers getting his hypercharge, so I wouldn't be surprised at all if he quickly moved back up into the A tier. So just keep that in mind. Rico is moving from the A tier down into the B tier. Another brawler that I am so glad to be seeing less of. Rico is very map dependent and he dominates on the maps that he's good on, but they're just aren't as many of those in the map pool right now, which is great because that means I don't have to ban Rico as frequently. Okay, now we get to talk about the A tier brawlers. These ones are a lot more useful in a lot more situations than the Btier brawlers. They're just not quite as good as the S tier brawlers, which are good like everywhere. Kit is staying in the A tier. Kit is pretty good on his own for a support brawler, and if his opponents don't specifically counter him, he can create some very easy wins for his team. Frank is staying in the A tier. Frank is slightly worse than before, but he's actually managed to remain in the A tier because he has so much health that your opponents have to draft around picking a brawler that can actually deal with Frank. So, he forces some interesting situations. Barry's moving from the S tier down into the A tier. Barry actually received a nerf to his healing a while ago and now that the brawlers that he supports aren't as good, he's not being played as much, but he's still a great A tier brawler. B is staying in the A tier. She received a nerf to her rattled hive gadget, and while she's not an A tier brawler, she's not quite as strong as before. Barley is staying in the A tier. Barley's just one of the best brawlers in the game that you can use if nobody on the map can break walls, so that's why he's there. Meg is moving from the D tier all the way up into the A tier. I'm not excited to see me being played more. She received her hypercharge after I made the last tier list, and it has made a huge difference for her. Plus, she got a movement speed buff to her while she's outside of her mecca, making her even easier to dodge shots. Ash is staying in the A tier. No changes were made to Ash this update, and he's just a little worse than before because of the current meta. Max is staying in the A tier. Max is another brawler that is usually good at supporting close-range brawlers, so she's being played slightly less, but she's still good. Ham is moving from the F tier all the way up into the A tier. She actually received a damage buff that also charges her super faster and now she is way better than before. She still also has not received her hypercharge yet which will make her even better. Lola is moving from the B tier up into the A tier. She received her hypercharge in the previous update and her stats are just so good that you really can't go wrong with her. Janet is moving from the S tier down to the A tier. Jan received a nerf to her hypercharge rate in the previous update. And now she can't cycle through her supers like she could before, but she's still a really great option. Amber is staying in the A tier. She is actually going to receive her hypercharges update, and she's still a solid A tier brawler without it, so she really just might be broken soon. Consider her for an S tier placement. Allie's moving from the S tier down to the A tier. Allie's had a few nerfs over the last few balance changes, and his lower survivability finally knocked him out of the S tier, but he's still in the A tier. He's still great. A great choice. Fin is moving from the B tier up into the A tier. Fin got a few major buffs in the previous update and he went from being a below average brawler to a really good brawler on most maps. Squeak is moving from the Btier up into the A tier. Squeak's actually been really good ever since the gadget rework. And even though he didn't get any buffs this update, the meta has shifted to be good for him in his favor along with some of the maps where there's a lot of choke points that Squeak can really take advantage of. Gan is staying in the A tier. Gen didn't receive any balance changes this update and he's still just being used on the same maps for the same reasons. Mr. P is moving from the S tier down into the A tier. Mr. P got nerfed quite a bit in the previous update since his hypercharge honestly just broke the game, but it's actually still pretty strong. Gray is staying in the A tier. Gray is one of the safest choices on almost any map because of how many brawlers he counters and how well he supports his teammates. Honestly, I don't want to see much more people playing Gray because he's actually really annoying to play around. Bonnie is moving from the F tier all the way up into the A tier. Bonnie received a rework to her super so that she can climb back into her cannon as soon as she wants. And even though she still doesn't have a hypercharge, this rework instantly made her a very good brawler, which is crazy. Lou is staying in the A tier. No changes were made to Lou this update and he's right where he was on the last tier list. Juju is staying in the A tier. She's still the best thrower in the game, but even she is somewhat map dependent and will actually lose to other throwers depending on the map. Buster's moving from the B tier up into the A tier. He received his hypercharge in the previous update and he actually got nerfed this update, but I guess his hypercharge made him so strong that he's still an A tier brawler. B is moving from the B tier up into the A tier. B is another brawler that received his hypercharge in the previous update and it made a huge difference for him. Melody is staying in the A tier. She actually didn't receive any balance changes this update and she's still one of the best aggressive brawlers in the game. Stu is moving from the S tier down into the A tier. Stu was broken in the previous update, mainly because of his speed zone gadget. And since it's been nerfed, he's not quite as good. Jay Young is starting in the A tier. Since the update's balance changes were a little delayed, we've actually been able to test out Jay Young quite a bit so far, and the pros agree that he is at least A tier. Mele is staying in the A tier. Mele received a very slight buff to his reload speed in the previous update, and I guess that's all it took to make him one of the best brawlers in the game. Angelo is staying in the A tier. Angelo remains the best sharpshooter in the game and probably could be considered S tier on certain maps where hovering over water makes a big difference, but overall he's not quite good enough for S tier. So, let's talk about the S tier brawlers. The best of the best, the band of the band. Carl is moving from the B tier all the way up into the S tier. He received his hypercharge in the previous update, and that combined with the recent gadget rework has quickly made him one of the most solid choices in the game on any map. Kaz is starting out her debut in the S tier. Now, Ka is the only brother on this on this tier list that has not been released at the time that I recorded this video, but she already has two different hypercharges, and I just don't have any reason to believe that she will not be S tier. So, I lied when I said that I didn't help with this tier list. I'm helping with Kaz, and that's it. But, I think she's going to be busted. Chester is moving from the C tier up into the S tier. Chester received his hypercharge in the previous update and it's so strong that it was the only thing that brought Chester from the C tier to being one of the best brawlers in the game. Hank is staying in the S tier. I know that people are not going to believe me and you're going to think I'm crazy, but the pros agree that Hank is one of the best brawlers in the game. He has only been nerfed since his hypercharge has released and he's still the best tank in the game by far, especially with the current map pool where there's a lot of walls for him to really play around. Lumi is moving from the A tier up into the S tier. Lumi actually was not released at the time that I made the previous tier list. And since she's only been nerfed, and she's still almost the best brawler in the game, I can see how you can see how strong she actually is. But she's not the best. That is deserved for our final brawler. Kenji is moving up from the A tier into the S tier as the best brawler in the game. Kenji is the only brawler who had his hypercharge this update when I reached out to the pros and it is easily the strongest hypercharge in the game and has made Kenji completely broken. And that right there is the competitive tier list. I wish that I could give you something that is currently perfectly accurate with all the brawlers that actively have hypercharges right now, but it just takes too long for me to make this video because I take so much time and effort to reach out to the pro players, take their feedback, put it all together into the the tier list, and then it also takes time to film, record, gather all the footage, send it to my editor. Like, it takes time to make these videos. So, I'm really sorry, but massive thank you to these pro players for helping out. I still think that this is a very accurate tier list with a few changes that will happen as brawlers do receive their hypercharges. I want to know what you guys think. So, let me know in the comment section below who your favorite brawler to play is right now and who you just hate playing against. For now, this is Kyos ticking by. We will see you in the next video."

    "creator": "Kashewz",
    "transcript": "These are the 10 best brawlers that you need to max out right now in Brawl Stars. Now, we're currently on season 38 and there's 92 brawlers in the game right now, but only a handful of these brawlers are worth maxing out right now. Yeah, dog, you're not getting maxed out this season. And yeah, stay tuned for the last three brothers on this list because these are brawlers that you need to max out, especially before they get nerfed and dropped to the F tier. And yeah, make sure to like and subscribe because I'm on my way to 200,000 subscribers. So, subscribe or you will turn into a coin. Coming in at number 10, we have the new brawler, Jay Young Gaming. Now, Jay Young is a really unique support brawler, and if you know how to properly use him, you can really take advantage of this brawler, especially at the max level. Now, with this brawler, you can speed up teammates with the super or heal them, which is really interesting. That's why it's called mix it up. And what's great about a super is that it recharges really fast, so you can quickly alternate between speeding up and healing your teammates. Jay Young also does a decent amount of damage for a support brawler and has a good amount of range. So, it's really easy to shoot enemies and also heal teammates. But yeah, I recommend maxing out Jay Young if you're looking for a new support brawler to max out. And if you plan on maxing out Jay Young, be sure to play him in 3v3 game mode so that you can be a support brawler and speed up your teammates and heal them. At number nine, we have Mr. Boomerang Gaming, Carl. Now, let me tell you something about this gadget. It is one of the biggest reasons why Carl is breaking this game. This gadget pretty much creates a flame that follows his attack. So if the enemy walks through that flame, they are cooked. Okay, now Supercell also gave Carl a hypercharge. And I'm not going to lie, I've never used this hypercharge and I actually still don't have it. And I am still getting a bunch of wins with Carl. But if you plan on maxing out Carl, I highly suggest getting his hypercharge as well because it will just make him 10 times more broken. And his hypercharge pretty much gives him a flame trail when he uses a super. So just imagine how much damage that can do. But yeah, Carl is a damage dealer and he's honestly good in almost any 3v3 game mode. If you're planning to play ranch, Carl is also a good pick depending on the modifier and map that you're playing. And yeah, if you've made it this far into the video, comment how many brawlers you have maxed out. But yeah, number eight is surprisingly big tank Hank. I mean, this shrimp used to be an F-tier brawler, so it's crazy to see that he's breaking the game right now. Now, Hank recently had his hypercharge released, and it really made him broken. His hypercharge pretty much auto aims the fish things that he shoots onto enemies, and they do a good amount of damage. Okay, I mean, just imagine using this thing in the middle of a gem grab map. Hank has also gotten several buffs. For example, he can now charge his super when taking damage. I personally don't use Hank that much, but every time I'm against one, I usually get cooked. Hank is really good in maps that have a good amount of walls because his attack literally goes through the wall and destroys enemies. Okay, now Hank's hypercharge did recently get nerfed, but it doesn't matter. Hank is still in the meta, and he's a great tank to max out for trophy pushing and ranked. At number seven, we have Amber Gaming. Now, Amber just got her hypercharge released, so it's a perfect time to max her out. She's also pretty broken without her hypercharge, but it's honestly best to take advantage and buy your hypercharge if you want to fully take advantage of this brawler. Now, the amount of range that Amber has is probably the most unfair thing. Like, how is this fair, dude? And don't even get me started with this hypercharge, dude. I mean, I don't even want to talk about it. Amber's hypercharge pretty much allows her to throw a huge puddle of oil, and it keeps burning for 3 seconds after being lit. Now, I think that Amber's super without the hypercharge only burns the oil for a few milliseconds. So, just imagine 3 seconds, dude. Like I mentioned before, Amber's hypercharge just got released, so it's a perfect time to max her out and take advantage of her new hypercharge, especially in 3v3 game modes. And even if you don't use her new hypercharge, she is still a very broken brawler. Just make sure to use a proper build for Amber. I have personally been using this build and it has been legendary gaming. Number six is Bonnie Gaming. Now, Bonnie actually got reworked this update, and this actually made her a better brawler overall. Now, what this rework did was allow Bonnie to instantly turn back into a sniper after jumping and whacking someone out of existence. Now, this puts Bonnie at a strong advantage, especially in game modes like Knockout. If you're low on health, for example, you can jump into another corner, instantly go back into sniper mode, and start sniping your enemies away. This rework really allows you to create more plays with Bonnie, especially in 3v3 game modes when you're playing aggressive. So, if you're looking for a solid marksman to max out, I highly suggest maxing out Bonnie. Now, it may take some time to properly learn how to use Bonnie in her new rework. Once you start getting some wins in and understand how to use Bonnie, max her out, okay? And yeah, we are almost at the final three brawlers that you need to max out this season. You don't want to miss these brawlers because they are completely breaking the game right now. At number five, we have Fin Gaming. And this is a control brother that you should definitely max out if you want. Now, Finins does a crazy amount of damage against enemies. And you don't even want to get me started with a super, dude. His super is extremely helpful in game modes like Brawl Brawl and Gem Grab. It slows down enemy attacks and speeds up teammates attacks, so you can easily dodge enemy attacks when you're in some crazy insane fights. Now, the best aspect about Fins is definitely the amount of damage he does and how his attack is structured. You can see here that his attack has three shots with the middle shot having the most range and damage. So, you obviously want the middle part of his attack to hit the enemy because it does more damage. But if there's other enemies nearby, they can also get hit by the right or left side of the attack. And that makes this brawler really good in 3v3 game modes. Binks also has some really good star powers and gadgets that you can use like the no escape gadget which literally freezes an enemy completely for 2 seconds or the star power thing that reduces the reload speed of enemies by 30%. And that is when they're hit by Finx's main attack. Now, if you're looking for another marksman to max out, we have B Gaming at number four. Now, I'm putting B on this list because every time I'm against one, I get cooked. Dude, B's super allows her to slow enemies down, and since she's a marksman, she can literally slow enemies down and spam snipe them. And B also does a ton of damage every time her big sting is activated, so that just makes her even more broken. Using B in open 3v3 maps is probably the best because your enemies will have little to no cover, so you can easily spam snipe them and whack them out of existence. The rattle hive gadget also summons four bees that makes a huge circle. And this circle of bees can deal up to 1,200 damage. Bee's honeycomb star power also allows her to get a shield when her big sting is activated. And you don't want to forget about her hypercharge, which splits her super projectiles into two at max distance. Even if you max out B and choose not to get her hypercharge, she is still an insanely broken marksman that you should consider maxing out. And that's if you're trying to get another max tier brawler or gain more elo in rank. B is really good in game modes like Gem Grab, Knockout, Bounty, and Brawl Ball. You can even get away with playing B and Showdown. But yeah, we are on to the final three brawlers that you need to max out this season. And listen, these brawlers are very broken. Okay, coming in at number three is the portable ice cream machine, Lou Gaming. And this is a brawler that you need to max out this season for sure. I have been using Lou for the past few months, and I've gained hundreds of trophies with this brawler. Blue has overall been a consistent brawler throughout the months, and this is a great brawler to use in Gem Grab, Hot Zone, and Brawl Ball. Especially if you're trying to gain trophies or push ELO in rank. Now, if you decide to max out Lu, I highly suggest using this build right here with this hypercharge because it is literally an infinite freeze build, dude. I mean, the gadget adds a 50% freeze meter to enemies. The star power makes enemies get frozen 33% faster, and the hypercharge instantly freezes enemies in the super, which is actually crazy. Now, Lou did recently get a few nerfs, but even with these small nerfs, he is still a consistent and good brawler that you should max out. Now, Lou is a really effective brawler in game modes like Hot Zone because you can literally infinite freeze your enemies, and I don't think they'll be able to reach the circle. At number two, we have Griff. And you probably might know why I put him on this list. Hypercharge Gaming. Now, apparently the tax rebate hypercharge is actually really broken and does a crazy amount of damage. So, I have a good feeling that it might get nerfed in the next balance changes. With that being said, I highly recommend you max out Griff, get his hypercharge, and take advantage and whack everyone out of existence in 3v3 game modes. You know what? I'm going to go ahead and take my own advice and get the hypercharge. Now, if you're wondering what Griff's hypercharge does, just take a look, man. How is that even fair, dude? Honestly, Griff's hypercharge is the main reason you should max him out. Even without his hypercharge, he's a pretty decent brawler. But if you want to fully take advantage of this brawler, just get his hypercharge, dude. But yeah, this is the number one brawler that you need to max out this season. And spoiler alert, this brawler is insane. And that is Kenji Gaming. He is breaking the game right now and you need to max him out. Kenji's mechanics are really good. And if you pair it with the right gadget and star power, he just becomes really broken. I recommend using the healing gadget for Kenji because he takes a good amount of damage when attacking at the closer range. And I use the study, the blade star power, which gives the slices a 30% increase in range. And you can't forget about the hypercharge, dude. This build itself is already enough to make Kenji broken. But if you want to bring him to the S tier and make him even more broken, you need to max him out and get his hypercharge. Kenji's hypercharge in 3v3 game modes is insane. It essentially pulls enemies to the middle of his super like Tara super and he actually ends up teleporting to the center of the X instead of going back to his starting location. If you decide to max out Kenji, be sure to purchase his hypercharge because it is a main reason why he's breaking the game right now and you need to take advantage of it before it gets nerfed heavy. Okay, but yeah, if you enjoyed this video, click on this video to see how you can max out your Brawl Stars account"

    "title": "Top 10 Best Brawlers In Brawl Stars (New Meta)",
    "creator": "Oky - Brawl Stars",
    "transcript": "Today I give you the 10 best brawlers and brawl stars enjoy. I start with the brawler Barry because in my opinion she is the best thrower at the moment. I think she is a bit on the underrated side of the brawlers. You don't see her often, but she is actually such a good brawler. This is because she can heal and also put a lot of pressure with her attacks and especially on these kinds of maps and game modes like Brawl Ball. She can really have a lot of influence on the game. You can help your teammates by means of healer or getting control, but you can also easily make kills yourself because she is good enough for that with her super and hypercharge. So, if you are looking for a good thrower to max or play, then it's Barry. As you might have expected, Kenji is also on this list. You probably see him a lot since his hypercharge came out. Actually, he has always been good, but since his hypercharge, he has only come into the spotlight. Of course, his hypercharge makes him almost broken, but without hyper, he is also very good. Kenji is a brawler that is easy to play and can have a lot of impact on your games. So, I definitely recommend you to max him. You can play Kenji best on close-range maps. He is a close-range brawler and is actually made to make kills and put a lot of pressure. So, you want to play him in game modes like Brawl Ball and Solo Showdown. So, I definitely recommend you to max Kenji. Maybe you wonder if it is smart to buy that hypercharge with gems since you can't buy it with coins yet. I say yes. If you also have his hyper, he can actually be pushed that high for free. It makes him a lot better because you can kill a lot of brawlers at the same time and help your team a lot. That's it for Kenji. Now I'm going to give you an underrated brawler that is in long range for the fans. I am of course talking about Carl. Carl is played more and more often and this is because people are realizing that he is actually very good. You can often use his fire gadget and really put a lot of pressure with it. You also do a lot of damage with your normal attack which makes you very good in 1v one situations. Carl is actually less good in brawl ball. maybe on long range Brawl Ball maps, but I would rather recommend playing him in premium or knockout. Also, for example, Gem Grab, just a brawler with which you can hold one side of the map well and win. Almost always use your attack before you super. There's no reason not to since it comes back while you're in your super. The next brawler you don't see very often, but is Ali. When using Ali, you need a high mid- damage brawler on your team. If possible, that brawler should be as long ranged as possible to be able to snipe hypnotized enemies from afar. Synergizes really well with, for example, Beia. As said before, brawlers with important supers are also really good together with Ali. Give them their supers. Attack before supering in. You will only need three attacks to get another super after that, which means another 4,000 HP. You can also use all eyes on me to extend the duration of the hypnotize. Try to hit two players with your super or attack. If you hit two with your super, both of them are probably already sentenced to death because you can use two ammos and have another super. If you only hit one, try to hit them through the hypnotized enemy. The next roller is Chester. I actually put Chester on this list because he doesn't need much skill, but is really good and can be played in many game modes and maps. Chester is actually a brawler that is just really chill to have max because you can easily push him and he has few counters. You can, of course, play him best on close and mid-range maps like in Brawl Ball for example. Then you can easily make kills and open the path to the goal. With your different supers, you can also do a lot. Each is useful in different situations, which is very useful. B is also on this list, and that is simply because of her damage. Her damage is very good, which automatically makes her very good. In general, Be is usable on a lot of maps because of her versatility in dealing with tanks. But by far, her best modes are Brawl Ball and Hot Zone with a specific team. When your opponent is slowed down by your super, don't hesitate to autoclick your attack, and you will never miss it. When enemies are hiding behind walls, you can easily touch them if you use your super in the right direction. So B is definitely a brawler you want to max because she is just a good option to play very often. The next brawler on this list is Gray. Gray is very underrated. Gray's main attack is simple but hard to hit because of how skinny his projectiles are. If you play a lot of marksman brawlers, you'll simultaneously become a better Gray player because hitting those shots is really important. Use super when a brawler is weak, and you can only make your enemy weak if you hit shots first. You can also act as a support brawler by placing your portals in a manner that provides better mobility for you and your teammates and thus helps complete the objective faster. If I were you, I would really master Gray because it is a very good brawler. It's my [Music] fire. Just one of my Hank is a tank brawler with a unique charge mechanic. His main attack is only strong when fully charged, which takes about 3 seconds. While charging, he's visible in bushes and can't heal, so you need to charge safely behind walls or cover. The attack pierces enemies and can hit behind walls if they're close enough. His super fires six torpedoes in all directions and heals him based on how much health he's missing, making it great for clutch situations or when surrounded. Hank isn't made for rushing. He controls space and punishes anyone who comes too [Music] close. Gene is a mythic support and control brawler with a versatile play style. His main attack shoots a medium-range projectile that splits into smaller shots if it doesn't hit a target, letting him pressure wide areas and pokes safely from range. His strength lies in his super magic hand, which pulls an enemy from far away directly to him. This is perfect for isolating key enemies, finishing off squishies, or disrupting the enemy team setup. He's not made for rushing or close-range duels. Instead, Jean thrives on patience, positioning, and timing. You play him by controlling lanes, poking from behind cover, and waiting for the perfect moment to use your pull. A good pull can instantly shift momentum, especially in team modes like Gem Grab, Brawl Ball, or Knockout. Gene is strongest when backed by teammates who can follow up his super. Don't waste the pull. Make sure you can confirm the kill or take map control after. His chip damage adds pressure and his star power can heal allies, making him a flexible support. Play smart, control space, and punish mistakes. Stew is a fast, aggressive brawler who thrives on mobility and pressure. His basic attack shoots two fast projectiles in a straight line with quick reload speed, making it easy to charge his super after just one hit. His super is a short dash that damages and knocks back enemies in his path. and it can be used repeatedly as long as he keeps landing shots. Stew's whole play style is built around chaining supers to stay mobile and unpredictable. You shoot, get your super, dash, reposition, and repeat. This makes him hard to pin down and great for dodging, escaping, or chasing kills. His dash also breaks obstacles, which can open up space or remove cover for enemies. He's best in modes like Brawl Ball, Knockout, and Heist, where speed and pressure matter. Don't stand still. Always be moving, dodging, and applying pressure. Use his speed to dive squishies, escape danger, or disrupt key targets. Steu isn't made to tank damage. He's made to outmaneuver and outplay. Timing and aim. Aim are everything. [Music] [Music] [Music] It seems a glow from your eyes. I never knew they could also lie gone. How can a heart just forget what's kept in stone? I need to know."

    "title": "4 World Champions Rank 91 Brawlers From WORST to BEST - Tier List",
    "creator": "SpenLC - Brawl Stars",
    "transcript": "Yo, what's going on guys? Welcome back to a brand new video on the channel. Inside of today's video, we're going to be ranking all 91 brawlers in the game right now. All the way from the very worst all the way up to the very best in a tier list. So, I've had the help from none other than the world champions themsel from Humble Boss Lukey and Semantic. I'll put all the links in the description. Go check them out on all their socials. Of course, they are the goats. They've helped me out with this tier list just because I've been a little bit busier with moving out and stuff. I feel like I've got a good understanding of the meta though. Don't think too much actually change from my list and then getting feedback from themselves. So, we've got a really solid tier list and you'll you literally won't get a more accurate tier list on the internet. So, make sure to subscribe for all future content on the channel. And without further ado, let's jump into it. So, F. We're starting off with Doug. And yeah, Doug is Doug. Other brawler joining Doug in the F tier is Sam. His hype charge is pretty broken, but you basically never get the hype charge in a game without it is absolutely terrible. So, you can't even get it in most pro matches. He's basically unusable right now. Now, we're going to be moving on to the Dtier brothers. So, most of these are just not the greatest in the meta. They probably only got a couple of use cases. And we're going to start off in the D tier with Clansancy. So, I wanted to put him in the F tier, but just because his hype charge is really, really strong, I'm going to put him in the bottom of the D tier, but still as standalone, Clansancy is absolutely awful. He's only good against multiple tanks, so at least he has a bit of a use case. Next up, we have Ma. M hasn't really received many buffs in the last year or so, and she still remains detailed in the meta. never seen in pro play. I think the only time you use her was to counter Poco and now Poco isn't the greatest in the meta. M just is never seen. The same goes for Bull. It's the same story because he's just been bad in a meta for years now. He's only good in heist on those base race maps like hot potato. Outside of that, he's basically unusable. So we have Chuck. So at least Chuck is really good in heist, but outside of heist, he's absolutely unbearable. He's so so bad. And with the heist rework as well, he hasn't got a lot worse, but he definitely has suffered a little bit because of his rework. Next one detail, we have a Rosa. And Rosa's fall-off needs to be studied. I feel like she's a brawler that's gone under the radar and she's just not seen anywhere even in bubble bushy maps. She just gets outpowered and outclassed. Next one of detail, we have BB. So again, another brawler that's only really good in heist and still she's just only good as a niche pick. Basically, she's just a walking super totem because she has such little range. She can never close the gap onto good players. The remaining D tier is Grom. A lot of people thought Gro's hype charge would be good and it impacted him in the meta. Yeah, I was right. It didn't impact him whatsoever even months go on because his basic attack is so hard to hit. Against noobs, he's really good. Against pros, he's never seen. Main D is Fang. Ever since they nerfed his hypercharge rate heavily, he basically never gets a hypercharge in pro play. And still there's just such better assassins in the meta. He's just never seen and hasn't been seen for a very long time. So we have Shelly. So Shel is only really good into tanks against any other brawler down the lane. She's really going to suffer. So you only really see her improve. D we have Edgar. So Edgar again the meta is not really going to be helping him out whatsoever. Hasn't received any buffs. Only good in heist. Outside of that he's terrible. And in D is Gail. So Gail the hypercharge rate nerf absolutely killed this brawler as I predicted. Everybody now is realizing just how bad Gail is. He's only really good on more open maps surprisingly because of his slow star power. Outside of that, you just basically don't use him because he's terrible even into tanks. Next up, we have Colt. So, Colt is only really good in heist. In heist, he's probably like an A tier brawler, but since the heist rework is actually impacted him a lot, and he's got even worse in that game mode. So, if he's not even the greatest in heist, he's absolutely unusable elsewhere. He really has fallen off. So, we have Jesse. So, Jesse received one of the smallest buffs you'll ever see, and it's not really done anything to her. No matter, surprise, surprise, she's really fallen off. even at low level. I don't even see that many people install lockup Jesse anymore. So, she's terrible at low ranks, terrible at high ranks, not usable. Next up, we have Ruffs. So, Ruffs has just been awful for a long time now. And I probably would say he's in a D tier right now. He just doesn't have the damage to keep up with any sort of aggression and his hypercharge was so hyped up. I thought it's going to be really good, but it just turns out that it's just awkward to use. Next in the D, we have a Meg. So you could argue that she's low seat tiered because of some pros in NA seem to go a little bit of Meg, but me personally, I just don't think she's good whatsoever. Hypercharge is probably the best thing about her. Outside of that, I just think she's too easy of a kill. And lastly in the detail, we have a Crow. So Crow received a small buff to his anti-healing, but let's face it, that's really not done anything. The healers at the top of the meta just aren't really as good as they used to be. Maybe in a real big healer meta a couple of metas ago, Crow would have been better, but if anything, it's got worse, especially since the highest rework. Now we're going to be moving on to your Ctier Brawlers. So most of these brawlers are pretty balanced or just a little bit worse than balanced, but they're going to be good in a lot of different situations. So starting off with Willow. So Willow recently received a hypercharge. The hypercharge super itself isn't anything flashy. But at least the stat boosts are pretty good. You can get hypercharge pretty quickly with her. So I think she's appeared a lot more in the brewable meta, maybe hot zone, etc. But she's still not good enough to make a big impact in the meta. So we have Maisy. So nothing's really changed about Maisie. If anything, she could be in the D tier and she has been for a very long time. NA overrated her some metas ago, but she's always been terrible. She's just so hard to hit the main attacker. Doesn't matter how much damage it deals, it's not good enough. Next up, we have Penny. So, another brawler whose falloff needs to be studied because she used to be the top picked brawler like 4 months plus ago. Then, the hypercharge rate nerf really did kill Penny off. You just don't really see her anywhere. There's just better options in pretty much every single situation. She's only really good in hot zone. Another brawler who's fallen off is Mr. P. Mr. P's hypercharge basically killed him. He is not good whatsoever anymore. The hypercharge just isn't good. By the time it even gets to an opponent, it's just completely decayed and it's so easy to take down. It doesn't have the pressure that he once used to have. Mr. P is completely completely dead. So C, we have Serge. So another brawler who's really not the greatest in the meta. The only time pros really play Serge is unlike Gem Fort, and that's even a stretch. He's not even that good into tanks right now because he's super super squishy. His hype charge isn't as good as it used to be as well. Serge has fallen off. He's not used anymore. So, we have Leon. So, another Brawl. I would say goes under the radar a little bit. Does deserve a little bit more hype in game modes like Bounty, etc. to counter those snipers, but for the most part, he's probably a bit too risky to play and he's just average everywhere. Spike is next. So, another brawler that's just pretty much average everywhere. But there still has been an improved use case for spike in game modes like heist because of maps like pit stop hot potato where a spike on the safe can just delete it in an instance with popping pin cushion and fertilize is decent outside of that is too easy to kill. Charlie is next in the C tier and Charlie in the AP pack region is like an A tier brawler. You've seen in the last monthly finals they spammed a lot of Charlie but I think they're heavily overrating her mainly because her Spidey's gadget isn't even that good anymore. She's like okay into most matchups, you know, maybe she's a brawler going under the radar a little bit, but she's not the old Charlie that we all look. We have Eve. So Eve is normally one of those brawlers where a brawler like Angelo and Juju are banned on like I don't know safe zone or something like that. Maybe Eve can just be a good cleanup brawler. She's just average. She's just good into some things, but she never has like a lasting impact on their game. It's just there's not really many counters to Eve, but then she doesn't counter anything else. She's just one of those brawlers that just exists. Next up, we have Sprout. So Sprout will always be at least decent in the meta because he counters for squishier brawlers in bounty and knockout. But outside of that, he really struggles and he's still not as good in those game modes as he used to be. So when it's we have Shade. So Shade's one of those brawlers that's heavily underrated when it comes down to a late pick in ranked, but it really takes the right player to make Shade work. If it's slight tempo playing Shade, he looks like an S tier brawler. But we can clearly see in pro games games is just not used that often. But you got to play it perfectly. And if you do, Shade is actually a good brawler. Next up, we have Rico. So, Rico is still one of the most played brawlers in the game right now, but that doesn't mean he's one of the best brawlers. His hypercharge rate was a heavy nerf to him. Also, his gadget nerfs have definitely caught up to him. He's only really good on a sle few maps, maybe on like Brawl Ball, but we'll just find him too easy to kill right now. Next in the C tier, so he's just on the cushion of being a balanced brawler. If anything, just on the weaker side a little bit, he's still really good and impactful on the map because of his hypercharge, but normally there is a better option. Dynamite is next and the gadget rework. I want to say killed dynamite but definitely made him a lot less of viable option because before you could just spam out but stun gadget now he's a lot more vulnerable to any assassins any aggro. His hype judge is still really good though. Next up we have El Primo. So El Primo is just good because he's always going to be a good counter to those other tanks if you need some aggression yourself as well. So if you're looking to counter like Frank or just some other high tanks in the meta then of course Primo is your guy. Good in heist, good in bral he's just okay. Next one of the seats here, we have Brock. So, another brawler that's a lot better in the lower ranks. I'd say Brock is an okay brawler because you can always somewhat pick him in heist later on in the draft. He's like okay and knock out in some bounty maps and he's good at just opening up the map as well. But more often than not, you open up the map and other snipers can counter you. So, he's not the best. Next one is C, we have Nanny. So, if you're talking about bounty and knockout, but super open maps and Nanny is like still a tier, but just because you can't really play Nanny outside of that. You know, before you used to be able to play Nanny in heist, other game modes, but you just can't really do that right now. So, you only use Nani to hyper counter a couple of snipers like Mandy, like Piper, Byron, etc. on maps like Shoot and St. We have Lola. So, Lola's hypercharge is just so so so bad. It doesn't do anything. It actually does nothing really. It It looks cool, but it takes forever to charge and it doesn't even do anything in the map. It just dies straight away. So, it's not really helped her in the meta. Next seated, we have Jackie. So, if we're talking about maybe NA and a few other regions, they probably overrated Jackie a little bit in the last monthly finals, I think she definitely has appeared a lot better in the meta because she's a good counter to certain brawlers on certain maps. You know, for example, like Ollie on maps like Gem For. She can be a bit of a nuisance. But outside of that, I still think she's not the greatest and just too easy to pinch. Next in C, we have Draco. So, Draco, of course, fell off because of the gadget rework. So, he's been stuck in his seat tier for a couple of months now. It just takes far too long for him to just use that broken gadget. But still, he does have the use case in hot zone. And if you pair him with a support brawler, he can pop off. Next one is seated, we have Cordelius. So, I've actually demoted him from the beat because I'm just not really seeing Cordelius whatsoever right now. He's only used to counter like maybe like cheesy kick compositions or if you're looking to counter a couple of aggressive brawlers, then in a 1 v one, he can be really really strong. But I just don't really see much Cordidas anymore. So, I I think we got to talk about him dropping off a lot now. And lastly in the C tier, we have Mo. So we could easily put Mo in the B tier thanks to his reload speed buff. It's definitely helped him out a lot in the meta. You see him a lot more in heist. You just see him as a late pick, maybe in gem grab as that type of assassin. The only thing that's not really going for Miko is he hasn't got the greatest of hypercharges, but in a one versus one, he's much stronger now thanks to his buff. So now we're going to be moving on to your Btier brawlers. So typically these are just a bit better than average and it can be used on multiple game modes. So starting off with Barley. So, I'd say he's on the cusp of Ctier here personally, just because, you know, Bali used to be always the go-to brawler when we're talking about hot zone and like on certain maps in BR, you know, in heist, etc., but I'm just starting seeing countered a little bit more frequently, but still B is a good option if you're looking for a throw up. And the same has to go for the twins as well. They're just on the cusp of C tier in my opinion because they're not really being played too much. I mean, once the twins get a hypercharge, they probably will go back to the S tier, but right now they just don't really have too much of an impact on the game. Next up, we have Otus. I wanted to put Otus in his seat tier, but then Semantic said a good use case for him is for countering brawlers like Kenji. Kenji is such a broken brawler in the meta. So, Otus has just got a bit better because of that in game like Gem Grab, Improv, Otus is always underrated because with the vision gear under Gadget, it can hold off pretty well. And of course, the hypercharge as well just hyper hyper counters those tanks. Next beater, we have Mortis. And Mortis is still such a good late pick in ranks. His hypercharge is still just fundamentally broken. It's just a team wipe machine. It doesn't matter if it takes you near the whole game to get your hyper charge. Once you get it, you can just change the game on its head completely. So, he's just a good late pick everywhere outside of heist. Next up in beta, we have Bonnie. So, I know I overrated Bonnie a little bit with the rework. I was just excited, okay, cuz Bonnie was useless for the longest time. I've still not had the most time to test out Bonnie and not really seen enough tournament gameplay, but I think Bonnie is a good brawler. She's good in knockout, good in bounty, and the great thing about her is, you know, she can farm super from the tanks or just other brawlers that get close to her. Then she can jump onto the throwers and the snipers. That makes a really good option. She can just revert back into counter form straight away. She's good in heist as well. Just think she's like just above average in the meta. And the same goes for Palam as well. These two brawlers got some of the biggest buff with the balance changes a couple of weeks ago and it was a big big damage buff with Pam and it's definitely helped her a lot in the meta. The problem is the map pool isn't the kindest to Pam and she's just like above average in most places. But I think people might be sleeping on Pam personally because that damage buff was so big. But then again, she hasn't got a hypercharge whilst most of the brothers in the game, pretty much all of them have one now. So that definitely does hurt her case in the meta. Next beater, we have Kit. So Kit will always be super annoying in the meta thanks to the way that he works with his healing. You just pair him with any type of tank and knock out bounty and he's basically unkillable whilst on top of someone. So he's always good in most game modes. So it always at least remain the B tier for me. Next one be we have Sandy. So Si is just a pretty good brawler when we're talking about gem grab, bro, and hot zone. You can never really go wrong with Sandy in some instances and especially because the hypercharge is still pretty good. Most of the time I'm seeing other lane options, but I think Sandy could be slept on a little bit there. Next up, we have Nita. So Nita has fallen down the meta just a little bit. That is because there's just so many better lane options right now in the meta. Or if you're looking to counter certain tanks or in high to be a big threat with a bear, Venita is the person for it because you can deal so much damage and the fact that the hypercharge only charges in two supers. You can just chain them so easily still. So Mo is next in the B tier and actually want to put Mo in a C maybe underrated him a little bit but literally all three of the pros just says straight away Mo is easily in the B tier and that is because Mo is quite versatile, right? He charged his super quite quickly thanks to the gadget rework. You can just spam the gadget that gives you the extra super charge and then you can just super onto any of those squishy brawers and get a free kill every single time. I just think he's versatile. You can play him in like ball gem grab hot zone and it's always like a use case for him there. Next one to beat him, we have Lily. So Lily's hyper charge has definitely helped her a lot in the meta and it's mainly because of those one versus one interactions. It's not nothing flashy. You're not going to get a ton of like T- wipes with it, but just because the pure damage you can deal with it is insane. And it's because normally tanks would counter Lily, but with this hyper charge, you can just rip through tanks. Takes a little while to get, but thanks to her charging circle, she can get it pretty quickly. And she's just a good option. Whether it be heist, whether it be gem grab, bubble, she can be really annoying still with a vanish gadget. Next in the beta, we have Squeak. So Squeak has dropped down one tier mainly because I'm not really seeing him used as much in most situations. I used to be able to blame him in brewable gem grab probably a bit too risky unless it's a late pick. So he's good against squishier options as a late pick and then a knockout bounty he's still a valid option because the wind up gadget is still really really strong and super annoying. Next up we have Byron. So if we're talking about use rate in competitive and Byron probably is like a sea tip on the meta but I just think he's a little bit underrated and a little bit underappreciated because he's still a decent brawler that can cycle super quite effectively. His booster shots gadget is still pretty annoying as well. You can play in gem grab hot zone. He just pairs with so many brawers still at the top of the meta. Next one to be we have Mele. So Mele received a slight damage nerf and it definitely impacted him a little bit in the meta before you know a couple of months ago you could play Meeple as the first pick and just absolutely dominate. There was hardly any counters. Now people are starting to realize a few of the counters a few of those lane brawlers will take like an extra shot to kill now. So Mele falling down a bit. Next in the beta we have Colette. So Colette didn't really get nerfed too much from the heist rework. So she's still going to be one of the best borrowers in heist. And then again, if you're looking to hyperfixate and counter those tanks, tanklet's always going to be a good brawler because of that. The hype charge is really good. The gotcha gadget to heal up as well, really good. So, she's always going to be stuck in a beater. Next up, we have 8bit. So, 8bit is just pretty decent in a few situations. So, whether you're looking for a damage dealer in heist, it's really good with the boosted booster star power, which is the better one. Even in gem grab as well. So, a lot of people play him in gem grab because he's one of the few mids that's quite tanky. So he's quite safe and doesn't die too often as a J carrier, but he's also good into those tanks as well, whilst most other mids are quite vulnerable. So feel like a bit will always have a decent spot in the meta because of that. Next in the beta, we have a tick. So tick is just always going to be really annoying knockout and bounty. Again, I will say it just seems like every meta that goes on, it gets a little bit worse just because a bit more predictable and his hype dodge isn't the greatest. So I think eventually probably go down to the C tier. Next in the beat, we have Poco. So Poco's definitely fallen down a few tiers. The gadget nerfs have definitely caught up to him. He's still like a solid option. You probably won't see as much in ranks because there's no hot zone. So, he's good in hot zones. Still still decent as a gem carry in most instances. But because brawers like Ollie aren't as dominant in the meta anymore, there's not as much as a use case for Poco anymore. Next, the beta, we have Mandy. So, Mandy still super annoying in the meta. One of the best brawlers in Bounty and Knockout because of that hypercharge. I don't think it got nerfed right. So, she's still a really solid option in the meta, but outside of that, she's not really the best. So BT is where she's at. Next up beta, we have Piper. So probably overrated a little bit in the last tier list. I think A is too kind to her because she's really good in knockout and bounty. But still in those two game modes, it's normally a better option, especially in pro play. Players know how to counter the Piper. You know, whether it be Nanny, whether like Gray, Max, or just any type of aggression on the map button. In certain maps, you can still be really dominant. I got to think about Piper, you can still play in that gem grab, any open map, heist as well. It's just down to the user. A good a good piper can make a look at EST. Next one, we have Arties. So Arty's dropped down the meta just a little bit in my opinion. I just don't think he's as solid as a pick as he used to be. He's still a really good brawler. I just think outside of knockout bounty, he don't really seem as much anymore. But if anything, he's like high beta. Next beta, we have Frank. So he's definitely dropped down a meta little bit here. He's going to go into the beta from the A tier. That is thanks to just a lot of brothers receiving hyper charges now that can just farm off the Frank. And normally with Frank, you could just go him into low DPS compositions. Well, a lot of those brawers that he used to counter have got hypercharges that can just help him or help kill him a lot easier. You've seen some support brawlers that can deal a lot of damage. Now, it's just not as good as it used to be. Next in the B, we have Pel. So, she's at the high B because she's always one of these underappreciated brawlers where should always get played a lot when it comes down to the nittygritty end of tournaments, whether it be bouncy, knockout, etc. But then outside of that, there's not really many places you can play her. Next up in the B, we have Ash, another brawler that's dropped down from the A tier. Mainly because you just don't see him played as frequently anymore, mainly because there's so many meta brawlers that just counter him and farm off him a little bit too much. But still, he farms for his hive choice pretty quickly. Whether you're playing bral or gem grab on a bushy map, he can still have a good impact on Ash. And the good thing about him is even some brawlers that counter him like Serge or just other tank counters, he can win that match up with his rats. Next one to beat him, we have Daryl. So Daryl's always a good brawler in the meta thanks to his rework not too long ago where he has two supers instead of one. So it's going to make him just forever a decent option whether it be in heist. He's actually really really good late pick in heist right now. He's in played everywhere safe zone any map like that he could just roll over water pretty safely and he's really good late on the draft in knockout as well because you can farm your hype charge for free. Outside of that I don't really see him. So lastly in the beat we have Tara. So if we're talking gem grab she's probably near the S tier. She's so good because you can charge hypercharge so quickly, but outside of amate bral, she's okay. And then when you look at other game modes, she gets weaker and weaker. So, it's hard for me to make a case for her to be above the B tier, but she's definitely getting better. I'm starting to see a lot more Tara. So, we're going to be moving on to your A tier brawlers. So, these are going to be some of the best brawlers in the game and in particular game modes are going to completely dominate. So, we're going to be starting off with Melody. So, she's on the bottom of the A tier because she's starting to get a little bit worse now because the hive charge takes a long time to get, but still the right melody player can just absolutely pop off. She's so broken in heist. Really good in brutal more open maps. She's just going to be able to dominate and still the hypercharge itself is broken. So, she's still really good in the meta. Next in the A tier, we have Fhinx. So, I think Fhinx is like a steady Btier brawler, but pretty much all of the pros said straight away Fhinx is an A tier brawler. That is probably thanks to his super just being really, really good. But the good thing about thinks is that he's actually a good counter to some brothers you might not think. So for example, if a dynamite super is coming, you just pop your gadget and rewind. If just any sort of damage is coming, you could just tap your gadget and just go back in time and regain your ammo as well. So if assassin's coming your way, you can spam out all three pieces of ammo, gadget, and then you have another three pieces of ammo instantly. That's just such a broken aspect about him. He's just decent in a lot of things. In Hot Zone, of course, he's really broken. is good in uh bubble. He's good in gem grab and you do see him used in other instances as well. That super is just an automatic win. Next minute 18 we have Gus. So Gus's impact in the meta has gone up just a tiny bit. His hypercharge isn't anything special, but it's still a hypercharge on a support brawler, but it's definitely going to help him out against assassins. It's not the craziest thing in the world, but it does charge it up pretty quickly. He's still going to be good in knockout bounty, good as a gem carrier. He's not in the previous peak that he used to be in previous metas, but he's still a lot better thanks to his hypercharge. Next, we have St. the recent nerf to his hypercharge. Probably has made him nearly a beat, if I'm honest. It takes a long time to farm his hypercharge, but he's still such a burst brawler and so good in 1 v1's thanks to his gasial star power. I just find it really hard to put him in the beads here. I can't do it, guys. Next minute, we have Bell. And when you always look at her statistics to monthly finals throughout years and years, Bella is always in the top 15, top 10 picks because she's just so hard to counter in the draft. She's just good into everything. It's just all down to the user. She's good into tanks. She's just good on those longer range maps. She's got an heist, bounty, knockout, gem grab as a gem car. So, I don't know. So much versatility with Bale. How can you not like her? Next minute, we have Bow. And I'm glad to say I was one of the few people that said Bow was so underrated in the last meta and now he's got even better and didn't even receive a buff. a couple of weeks ago. Thanks to his hypercharge, it's really elevated him to a new level. So, he's one of the best brawlers in heist because his his super can just deal so much damage. His hypercharge can just deal 25 plus% instantly with trip wire activated. So, he's one of the best heist brawlers. He's really good in gem grab because you can just spam out mines like crazy and the opponents just forget where they are. He's good in other game modes as well. Hot zone. He's just so versatile. How can you not like both? Next, I went with Grace. So in the previous meta, he absolutely was S tier. Pros were abusing him even in gem grab, etc. But I think now with the meta changing a little bit. He's just dropped down at a tier. He's still really good in knockown bounty. Even with the walking cane, gadget nerf, I mean, he has impacted him a little bit. You can definitely feel it, but still the gadget itself is so broken. He goes for a hyper charges pretty quickly. Still such a solid option. Next minute at I went with Berry. So he's going under the radar like crazy right now. If you guys didn't know, two balance changes ago, he was supposed to be nerfed in his main attack healing. I think it was 10% 50, I can't remember. It was above 10% which really did impact in the meta and then there was a bug that reverted this nerf and this is what he's at right now. He's the same old berry that was s and broken a couple of metas ago and people aren't realizing he's such a good brawler in hot zone gem grabbable. He farms through super and hypercharges so fast. Next tier we have Buster. So thanks to his hypercharge, he's definitely got a lot better. He received a slight HP nerf which really didn't do anything. Buster so good in knockout bounty. any slowpaced game mode. He can farm his hypercharge for free just by standing next to his teammates. His gadget is still so busted. He's still easily an A tier brawler. Next to the A tier, we have Lou. So Lou is still such a meta brawler, especially last monthly finals. He's in the top 10 usage rate. So just going to show how much of a great counter pick he is for those tanks. He's always going to be good in hot zone. If you're looking for a defensive and heist, he's going to be your guy. Mainly because his hypercharge is just such a good shutdown to those assassins and tanks. They just can't do anything until 80. We have Guju. So Juju has forever been in the top 15, top 10 brawlers in the game ever since her release. She's just so versatile as a thrower that can just outrange so many different brawlers, that has a super that can defend herself against assassins and tanks, a gadget that is so broken that can go invisible, give a shield, etc., Guju is just good everywhere. Gene is next in the 80s. So for most people, they won't actually think Gene is that good. But in terms of pro play, he's always in the top 15 in terms of ban and pick rate in monthly finals because he's so good in knockout and bounty. And thanks to the gadget rework, he can spam out his vengeful spirit gadget even more confirming a lot more kills and getting more pressure. He's good in gem grab as a gem carrier. He's always going to be good because with vision gear, he can just be so OP on maps like double switch for example. And then again, he can pair really well with so many different brawlers with his magical stop. Janet is next in the A. Janet is always going to be a strong brawler as long as they don't completely butcher her hypercharge. Her hypercharge is one of the best in the game. It's just guaranteed a kill every single time. And then in other situations, she's just decent. In most matchups, she's got a decent amount of HP. Her gadget can be really annoying. On those bushing maps, she's going to be really good as well. In gem grab, she's probably the best brawler. In other cases, she's starting to get countered a little bit more, but she's still one of the best. Next, we have Cole. So, since his gadget damage nerf, it has toned him down a little bit. It's not just every single time you see someone, they're just dead no matter what anymore. Now, it's like, well, there's some good damage, but you still got to finish off the kill a lot time with a super. His hypercharge is still pretty fast charging, so you can cycle through it quite effectively and confirm some good kills. But outside of that, Cole definitely has seen a bit of a drop in play rate. Angelo's next in the 18. Angelo is such a good brawler in this meta. He's really good in heist, knockout, and bounty. And just because he can deal so much damage when you pierce through walls, he's just such a good asset. So next tier, we have Amber. So this is more of a prediction. Her hypercharge has only been out one or two days by now. So her hypercharge is completely utterly busted, but it does take quite a while to charge up to it, but once you do get it, it's basically an automatic team wipe. She was starting to fall down the meta previously in like the beaten, not being picked so often, but now I feel like she can be such a good brawler again in hot zone, in heist, emberable, and gem grab. It's mainly her versatility. She's just good into everything, and the hypercharge has helped her bring her back to the top of the meta again. So next up in 18, we have Griff. So, I'm going to predict that he might be low S tier, but I'm going to say high A tier for now after speaking to a couple of the pros who have not tried him out too much, but his hypercharge is so broken. It's completely and utterly busted. I wouldn't be surprised if he's top three brawler in the game. That is kind of my prediction, but I'm going to play it safe and put him in a top of a tier because the problem with Griff that I did face if you seen my second channel video is that against the tougher matchups, it's going to be hard to get his hype charge. But then again, all you need is one high charge super in the game and you can just team up with easy super. just goes through walls and deals insane damage is just absolutely ridiculously broken. But again, if you not got a favorable matchup, you're never going to get the hypershot. And lastly, in a tier, we have Max. So Max again is on a cusp of S tier because some of her better counters have been dropping down in the meta, like Poco for example. But Max is always one of the most versatile brawlers and always one of the most played brawlers for pro players. Mainly because Max is just good into everything and also good with everything on your team. So a brat hard has any counters and some of the top meta counters like Frank, like Poco have dropped down in meta actually made Max even better. And the hypercharge is the main reason why she's so broken. It's just gives you map control instantly. All three of you group up in the same position. You all get 75% of your super. You all just get sped up for so so much in just equals a goal. Gem grabbit equals control, etc. Max is so good in a meta. So now we're going to be moving on to your S tier brawlers. So these are the best brothers in the game. You can pretty much play them anywhere and once you get your hands on them, you can just tell instantly that they're so powerful. So, starting off in the S tier with Ollie. So, he's dropping down the meta just a little bit. Mainly because a lot of tank counters are starting to get hypercharges and become a lot better in the meta, but still Oie is just going to be infinitely good because he's a tank that can dash forward, that can jump over walls that has just got so much about him. He's one of the tankiest brothers in the game. Still, he can just make a play whilst other tanks struggle to just take over the game like he does. Next for the F tier, we have B. So even after another nerf to her Rattled Hive gadget, she still proves to be one of the best brawlers in the game. Bee just really packs a punch in the meta because of her hypercharge and really just allow her to completely dominate. But it's still the rattled hive gadget that just gives her ultimate control. I think for her to be removed from the Esther, they probably need to nerf the damage or something along those lines because she's too versatile, too good at shutting down so many different options in brawl, in gem grab, in hot zone, clean duty, whatever game mode you're playing in any control base that's outside of knockout and bounty, B is your brawler. Now, moving into the best five brawlers in the game right now. Starting off at number five, it is Chester. So, Chester received another hypercharge rate nerf, and it's still not enough to knock him from the Esther because the hypercharge super itself is completely busted. I kind of wish Supercell would actually fix a lot of these hype charges by just broken mechanically instead of just giving them hypercharge rate nerfs. I know it's a good quick fix, but it's just a hypergearge super itself with chess. It's one of the longest charging ones as well. It takes four supers to get, but just it it just one shots pretty much everything in the game and it's also the chaining potential that I don't like with the hypercharge. Like you can just throw this onto one tank, by the time it hits someone with a poison cloud, etc., you've got another one, you can throw it onto the next person and then once you hit them, you throw it onto the next. just equals a team wipe in so many different situations. That's why he's so busted. And of course, as a tank counter with a lot of the assassins becoming really strong in the meta, he's got even better. Now, moving into the fourth best brawler in the game right now, I went with Jay Young. And a lot of people were underestimating this brawler. I've seen a lot of content creators underestimating him. But me myself, I knew he was going to be an edstate brawler in the meta just purely because of his versatility as a support brawler that with his main attack that can speed up him and his team is just absolutely insane. And then every what 7 seconds you automatically get your super for free, giving you and your teammates any max speed or a little bit of a heal buff. And then on top of that, he's a support brawler that can just deal some insane burst damage as well through a wall as well with his damage gadget. So although he may lack absolutely like a ton of DPS, he's the support brawler. He's not going to be able to do teamworks and etc. But with a good team, Jay Young is so incredibly strong. You compare him with pretty much everything. It reminds me of just a better version of Max at the moment. And without a hypercharge, I'm pretty scared once Jayong gets a hypercharge how broken he'll be. But he's got to be easily one of the most underrated brawers in the game because I'm still not seeing randoms pick Jay Young even though he's so so good. So moving into the third best brawler in the game right now. We got our Milky Boy Hank. He still is one of the best brawlers in the game. He had the second most played/banned rate in monthly finals not too long ago. And even this met received no nerfs which was just crazy to me because the thing about Hank right is that he's been terrible for a long time but Super were really reluctant to buff him because you remember upon release he was very toxic with his main attack. But it's the same issue right now. So you can just charge up a 4.2k bubble which just pressures the enemy just with his main attack which is crazy. And then the thing is with Hank, you literally hit one of those shots, maybe even two, and you've got your first super. It's impossible for people to get close to you. Normally Hank, you should try and get close to him, try and counter him, interrupt his bubble, but it doesn't matter if you get close to him while he's got a big shield gadget that can defend himself. He's got a super that deals insane damage up close and then it heals him on top of that. So he doesn't even like if you're a good Hank player, you never have to stand still and fully heal up. You're always charging up your bubble and you're always getting good pressure. And then a hypercharge on top of that is pretty good. Pros were even playing Hank on the most disgustingly open map. So playing him on out in the open. They're playing on all these open maps and he was still working. He's so broken, guys. You need to play him. So now we're going to be moving into the second best brawler in the game right now. A lot of people may say he's the best in the game. Just missing out in my opinion. It is Kenji. Kenji is completely busted thanks to his hypercharge. So without it, he was like a low B tier of the meta. He still was okay, but he just wasn't played by pros because of better options. But now thanks to his hype charge that charges quite quickly on top of a really good healing gadget, on top of a good damage deflecting star power, he just becomes this really annoying just assassin. I just I can't I can't wrap my head around Kenji's hypercharge. It's completely broken. It's a Tara super from the air that is unavoidable. The area that it covers is just insane. And then on top of that, you teleport to the spot. Not only like you should probably just get the kill anyways with a hive charge, but it just deals insane damage. You land on top of them. They're just all disorientated. You're just spamming. You also get the heal on top of the hypercharge suit, but it just it's broken. Completely and utterly busted. There's nothing you can do to counter it. Kenji is done broken in this meta. Okay, so now moving on to the best brawler in the game right now. I went with Lumi. It seems like the boring option, but Lumi, the balance changes. and they were going to do absolutely nothing to her. They didn't fix a few key problems that makes Lumi so good. They nerfed her gadget cool down which was a good nerf but still the gadget itself is really really good. They nerfed her HP but they didn't nerf her just being able to spell out her main attack and also the slow power on top of that. It makes her such a toxic brawler that can just deal insane damage on the recall as well as again as the fact that Lumi was pretty much banned. Ro, she banned every single game except for one in monthly finals and then she was picked the game that she weren't banned and she didn't receive any meaningful nerfs. She's just so versatile, so annoying. You can even just leave your main attacks on the ground and you just automatically get in control because anyone wants to get close to them, you can recall them, slow them, and just destroy them. So, Luma is easily the best brawler in the game in my opinion. Way too versatile. So, that's going to be it for today's video, guys. Hope you enjoy. So, you can see the tier list on the screen. I've included K here because well, she's going to be coming out in a couple of weeks time and I think she's going to be absolutely disgustingly broken. I didn't want to talk about that too much, but yeah, how can't she be broken? But that's going to be it guys. Hope you enjoyed it. Let me know whether there's anything that should have been changed. And again, make sure to check out Boss Luke and Semantics links in the description below. And if you like me collaborating with some pros, also let me know what other pro team you want next. Maybe SK, maybe a Tribe NA, maybe another team like that. So, don't forget to like, comment, and subscribe. to see you guys next time."

    "title": "¿LUMI es INMUNE al NERF? 😧 10 MEJORES BRAWLERS de BRAWL STARS",
    "creator": "Twenty",
    "transcript": "Hey, ¿qué onda? ¿Cómo están? Hoy te vengo a mostrar a las bestias, los leones, los poderosos. ¿Qué [ __ ] sigue siendo Hang acá? Yo pensé que iba a durar dos semanas en el meta. Han salido nuevas hipercargas que han movilizado mucho a ciertos personajes, sobre todo el primer puesto que no figuraba hace mucho y ahora es un peligro andante, como esas nalgas del primo. Increíble. Si te gustaría dar una nalgada al primo, tenés que tener el código tu antipuesto. Ahora mismo estamos sorteando tres. Ah, no. Puesto 10 para Yuyu. Step up o step up. Decirte, es muy difícil que Yuyu deje de ser una de las mejores brawlers porque sus habilidades la vuelven tan híbrida que se puede adaptar a casi cualquier modo de juego, teniendo no solo las características de un lanzador, sino también más rango que un francotirador y habilidades robadas como ralentización o poder hacerse invisible. Esto no solo hace que sea la mejor lanzadora de entre todos los lanzadores, sino también la mejor elección entre Brawler que ni siquiera cumplen su rol. Por ejemplo, a un Da Sprout les cae un Edgar o un Mortis, se mueren. En cambio, Yuyu le chupa un huevo. A cualquier otro lanzador le aparece un Grey en la cara, se mueren. En cambio, Yuyu le chupa un huevo. Los demás lanzadores dependen de un modo específico para funcionar. Esto a Yuyu le rechupo un huevo. Ojo, tampoco es que sea una brawler indestructible ni que vayas a ganar todas las partidas por solo usarla. Pero si de por sí antes estaba en un mal puesto para nada, ahora que tiene supercarga, ni hablar. Igualmente no es que tenga mucho para profundizar, es literalmente lo mismo, pero un poquito mejor. Aunque ese pequeño cambio le permitió estar hoy dentro de este video y vas a jugarla, te recomiendo su segunda estelar y su segundo gadget. Y en cuanto a modos, capaz que no es la mejor en uno en específico, pero como es tan recomendaría cualquiera. Tal vez tendría cuidado con atraco y supervivencia solo. Pero no te confíes porque en este puesto también podría estar Berry, Janette, Grey y Jae Jong. Y son brawlers muy fuertes en este momento, pero no me parecieron tan híbridos. Puesto nueve para Low. Keep it Frosty, loco, puedes dejar de ser meta por solo 5 segundos. Low es un Brawler que de por sí viene estando muy bien desde hace bastante tiempo, pero ahora por lo que más destaca realmente es que en realidad no hay otros antitanques que estén destacando tanto, lo que hace que se vuelva una de las pocas opciones que hay y como encima sí es bueno, termina siendo una bestialidad. Lo que tiene la es que cuenta con mecánicas muy sólidas que en buenas manos pueden cubrir cualquier tipo de rol en la partida. Querés usarlo agresivo, podés. Queres usarlo defensivo, también podés. es un personaje con muy buenas herramientas para coerear a los tanques y también para defenderse de sus propios counters. Pero como en este momento se enfrenta más a tanques que a sus counters, hace dulce, bueno, helado. Algo que llamó mucho la atención en los últimos cambios de balance es que no se atrevieron a tocar su hipercarga y claramente es una de las razones por las cuales el brawler se encuentra tan fuerte. Esto viene siendo así, hace muchos metas y el tipo pasa tranquilo. Y por otro lado tenés a D que se está muriendo de hambre y no le dan una pisca de comida. Pero bueno, por lo menos considero que no es un brawler para manquito y eso de alguna manera me hace sentir mejor. Si vas a jugarlo, te recomiendo su segunda estelar y su segundo gadget. Y en cuanto modos, te voy a recomendar Hotson, balón Braul y supervivencia dúo, por más que en la mayoría se desenvuelve bastante bien. Solo intentar alejarte de los que sean muy agresivos como duelos o supervivencia solo, pero tampoco es la perdición. Puesto ocho, para Bea. Be, una Brawler con un caso muy similar al de Low, ya que Bea también es un excelente antitanque y como dije, no es que haya muchas más opciones disponibles. Bea en realidad viene estando fuerte desde el meta anterior, para el cual no subí video de los mejores brawlers, perdón. Y en respuesta a eso, Supercell le nerfeó un poquito su segundo gatet, lo cual claramente no fue suficiente porque sigue estando muy roto para meter presión. ¿Vos has visto el alcance que tiene eso? Hay brawlers que les cuesta muchísimo poder avanzar y vea con solo apretar un botón verde puede hacer un montón de áreas y posta es serio porque he escuchado más sobre este Gatet que su nueva entre comillas hipercarga ya que esta habilidad es una que si bien no está nada mal tarda bastante en cargarse y por más que podamos hacer muy buenas jugadas con estas es que el gadget es gratis solo hay que esperar. Pero sí imagínate tener una hipercarga y que no sea lo único que mencionan de vos es porque debes estar muy fuerte. Aprovéchenla porque en este momento no sufre tanto con sus counters y sí le hace mucha pupa a su víctima. Se recomiendo jugarla con su primer estelar y por más que lo hayan nerfeado, su segundo gad. Y en cuanto a modos, como son de categorías similares, te voy a recomendar un poco lo mismo. La mayoría de los modos están bien, pero intentaría alejarme de modos agresivos como Supervivencia solo y también de atraco. Puesto siete para Chester Surprise. Literalmente es capaz de bajarse un equipo entero con una ulti percargada y si solo le da a uno o a dos rivales, va a cargar la ulti de vuelta antes de que se la acabe esta. Y sí, estoy quedando un poco mal porque dije que no habían muchos antitanques y hasta ahora este video ha sido solo de ellos, pero bueno, para más de 80 brawlers tampoco es mucho. Igual este también es un muy buen counter para algunos asesinos y no siempre lo vamos a encontrar en los mismos modos que los anteriores. Si te pinta la ludopatía o querés jugar con Chester, que es lo mismo, te recomiendan su primer estelar y su segundo gadget. Y en cuanto a modos, te recomiendo jugarlo en atrapagem, balón brawl y supervivencia solo, pero en cualquiera vas a estar bien. Solo intent alejarte de noqueo o casa estelar. Puesto seis para Bter. The show, un brawler que difícilmente vaya a caer el meta, ya que cuenta con características básicas muy buenas como el rango, el daño y el poder atravesar con sus ataques. Además, la capacidad que tiene de cargar S cuando sus aliados están cerca se trasladó a su hipercarga y por más que no es una locura, está muy bien. Y como siempre dicho, no todo recae en cómo cambia la ulti. La potenciación de características que te da esta hiperhabilidad también cuenta y mucho. De hecho, algunos pro players la activan y ni siquiera usan la ulti. diría que lo único malo es que una de sus habilidades y un gadget le dan una sinergia tan buena que las otras no son usadas, cosa que capaz lo vuelve menos híbrido, pero eso importa generalmente cuando el brawler no está muy fuerte y ahora mismo también le chuco un huevo. Ese gadget de atraer muchas veces se traduce en una kill facilísima de la cual todos hemos sido víctimas alguna vez. Y es que si encima hace más daño mientras más cerca esté, no hay forma de escapar. Es como el DLC de la ulti de Tara. Te tengo que recomendar su segundo estelar y su segundo gadget. No hay de otra. Si es por su modo atrapa gemas, balón Braul, supervivencia dúo y Noqueo son su favorito, pero como ya es costumbre trata de alejarlo en atraco si de por sí nadie jugaba atraco con este meta menos. Puesto cinco para Oli. Nuevamente tenemos un Brawler al que le metieron un nerf en los últimos cambios de balance y poco le importó, que desde que le hicieron ese rework apenas salió, lo que hace que pueda disparar cuando usa la ulti, lo volvieron una bestia. Y es una fórmula que se ha visto repetida a lo largo de la historia de Brawl Stars. Cuando un tanque tiene buena movilidad va a ser muy potente y a este caso le subamos la capacidad de hipnotizar y por lo tanto paralizar de alguna manera a los rivales que tenga a su alrededor, porque no solo le sirve para que lo sigan a donde él vaya, sino que también le da mucho juego para llevar a cabo ciertas estrategias. Fíjate cómo es que un tanque sin hipercarga puede destacar tanto en el meta. Y no es por volver a traer siempre el mismo tema, pero con do podrían aplicar un par de estas cosas porque aunque el nerf principio que le hicieron fue a su vida, la movilidad es lo que siempre lo va a mantener en el todo. Recomiendo jugarlo con su segunda estelar y su primer gadget que es buenísimo. En este caso ya tenemos un tanque, así que te recomendaría jugarlo en Hotson, balón, Br, cualquier supervivencia y duelo. Y te diría que te alejes, de atraco y c estelar. Puesto cuatro para Carlo, un brawler superhíbrido que tiene uno de los mejores winredes cuando lo enfrentamos contra un brawler mano a mano. Este recibió un nerf en su primer gadget que hizo prácticamente nada, no solo porque sigue estando muy bien, sino porque también su segundo gadget es muy usado, permitiéndole cambiar entre un modo daño a un modo velocidad. Además, ahora el efecto de su primer gadget lo puede conseguir con su nueva hipercarga, que combinada con su segundo gadget es literalmente un tornado del cual no se puede escapar. Amigo, esta combinación sí que lo ha propulsado. Por más que no se pueda hacer en todo momento de la partida, sigue teniendo el combo normal, que es este Get con su ulti sola. Y eso de por sí es un combo bastante letal, pero lo mejor es que hacer daño ni siquiera es su única función. Este es un brawler que te puede meter muchísima presión, te puede espamear su básico infinitamente y su rango combinado con su efecto boomerang le permiten hacer jugadas magistrales que definen el resultado de un enfrentamiento. Pero volviendo el hipercarga se hace valer muy bien por más que no lleve su segundo gadget, convirtiéndose en un brawler con varias combinaciones diferentes para adaptarse como mejor pueda a cada partida y modo, no como Bter. Te recomiendo su segunda estelar y cualquiera de sus dos gadget. Primero sigue estando muy bien y si te digo que tiene un modo malo, te miento. En este momento puedes jugar car donde quieras. Ahora pasamos con los tres mejores brawlers de este meta. Brawlers que se han ganado un renombre en esta temporada o que lo mantienen el anterior como vos si es que estás suscrito al canal. Empezamos por el top tres. Hank. Trataron de tirarlo abajo, pero él no tiró abajo a ello. Hank fue el segundo brawler más usado y más baneado en las finales mensuales y aún así no recibió ningún tipo de nerf. Y es que si bien los ha recibido antes, el Brawler siguió estando roto, pero un poco más entre las sombras. Y muchos van a creer que estoy exagerando, pero realmente cuando Han consigue su primer sú, de ahí en adelante es muy difícil tirarlo abajo. Es un poco como el efecto Tara, que cuando consigue su primer agujero negro, su ulti puede ir ciclándolas con mucha facilidad, nada más que en este caso también le cura el 50% de su vida máxima. Además, desde que recibió su hipercarga se pudo jugar en mapas abiertos, lo cual hizo un antes y un después para este personaje. Es muy difícil balancearr Hang, así que o va a estar muy bien o va a volver a estar mal. Por lo que si sos fan del personaje o te causa gracia como a mí, aproveché a usarlo porque no sabemos qué destino le depara. Te recomiendo que a mi gambita le pongas la primera estelar y su segundo gatel. Está muy cómodo en todos los modos, capaz que en supervivencia solo no destaca tanto, pero no es que sea una basura. Puesto dos para Lumi. RS of Destruction, la típica nueva brawler rota que después termina nerfeando, solo que se olvidaron de nerfearlo. Bueno, en realidad no. Lume recibió dos nerf, uno a su vida y otro al tiempo de recarga de uno de sus gadgets, pero no fueron nada. Como la mayoría de nerf de los últimos cambios de balance fueron muy leves. O sea, que Lumi sigue estando casi tan rota como el día que salió. Y es que en realidad sus mecánicas de base sí están bien, pero nada de ellas es que sea tremendo. Lo que pasa es que a cualquier Brawler que le pongas un millón de daño por básico va a estar roto. Y si bien no es el caso de Lumi, la cantidad de daño que puede hacer de ida y vuelta con ambas masas es muy grande. Además, su segundo estelar le permite ralentizar a los enemigos cuando vuelven las masas durante 2 segundos. 2 segundos dentro del frenetismo de una partida es un montón. Y Lumi puede hacerlo ilimitadamente, ya que sus básicos nunca se acaban. La ulti de este personaje está bien, pero no es lo que más destaca de ella, no tanto como sus básicos, por lo menos. Pero sobre todo que podamos inmovilizar a un enemigo durante un segundo, aunque esté detrás de un muro, le da mucho juego para seguir siendo insoportable. Pero eso sería todo, tampoco hay mucho más que destacar. Como digo, es una brawler con mecánicas bastante básicas, pero que están muy fuertes. Así que si querés, aprovecha porque algo me dice que no va a salir así en un tiempito. Te recomiendo jugarla con su segundo estelar, claramente, y su segundo gadget y sus modos. todos y puesto número uno para Kenji. ¿A quién se le ocurrió esa hipercarga, amigo? Es un personaje que muchos de ustedes no se veían venir, pero es que la hipercarga le hizo todo el trabajo sucio. Agregar la ulti y tara encima de la habilidad que ya tenía me parece estúpidamente cheto. O sea, me está diciendo que a Kenji le dan esto y que la hipercarga de Tara solo hace que su ulti sea un poquito más grande cuando le podrían haber dado esa boludez. Kenji ya de por sí venía siendo un brawler muy sólido y ahora con esta habilidad es que no tiene counters. Bueno, igual pensando en frío, no creo que sea el mejor brawler que hemos tenido en un primer puesto de estos videos, pero sin duda es una de las mejores hipercargas y no la mejor que tiene Brawl Stars actualmente. Y teniendo en cuenta que es invulnerable mientras usa la sú que sus habilidades y gadgets son bastante buenas y que tiene muy buena movilidad, literalmente con una mano podría estar cortando sushi y con la otra racándose los huevos. Igual te va a ganar. Si puedes aprovechar la oferta de hipercarga de Kenji, aprovéchala porque no te vas a arrepentir, aunque la vas a querer acompañar con su segundo estelar y su segundo gadget. Sus modos no hace falta que los diga, ¿no? Si te esperabas ver a Y Jong alto en el top es porque capaz no conocés tamban bien sus mecánicas. Te dejo por acá su video Desmintiendo mitos para que lo sepas. Sino por acá un video que te va a estar recomendando YouTube a vos personalmente. Yo soy Tent y Sin Dolor no hay gloria."

    "title": "The 10 Best Brawlers in Brawl Stars (New Meta)",
    "creator": "Hypo - Brawl Stars ",
    "transcript": "Balance changes are out, hypercharges have released, and the meta has shifted. So, today I will be giving you the 10 best brawlers in Brawl Stars. Have fun and let's go. Barry is the 10th best brawler in Brawl Stars. Barry is a versatile thrower that is very good at supporting his teammates and controlling areas. Make sure to play Barry with tanks because he can constantly heal them up while charging his super. You can also use his attacks to cover lanes and control key points because his attacks last for so long. How supers and hypercharges cycle so quickly, making him even better. Play him on hot zone and Brawl Ball because his control and healing will shine on those fast-paced modes. Never play him on long range maps because he will get countered easily. Buster is the ninth best brawler. Buster has been rising up the meta and he was used a lot in the recent monthly finals. Buster is a tanky brawler that deals high damage and is good at making plays. The good thing about him is that he can get his super and hypercharge for free when standing near his teammates. This is why many people play him in knockout because he can get his super in the early game so he has it ready at the end. He is also good in Brawl Ball, Gem Grab, and Hot Zone because of his aggressive play style. He is even good on long range maps because he can still get his super and apply pressure with it. Lou is the eighth best brawler. Lou is a great brawler that excels in disrupting enemy movement and controlling areas. He is primarily used as a tank counter because his attacks can easily freeze them and he can trap them with his super. Him and Chester are the only brawlers that hard counter those aggressive compositions. If the enemies go Poco with two tanks, Loyal can effectively shut that down. His best modes are hot zone and Brawl Ball. In these modes, he can use his super to cover key points and allow his team to take control with ease. Lou is also good into longrange brawlers as he has good range himself. His versatile abilities make him a solid option everywhere. Carl is the seventh best brawler. Carl is a high damage dealing brawler with good range and enough health to hold his own. His main attack can pierce through targets which makes him good against swarms. His super makes him spin around dealing high damage at close range. This makes him hard for assassins like Edgar and Mortise to take him down easily. But his heat ejector gadget is what shines in his kit. The burning rocks do so much damage and give him area control for a few seconds. But he can always switch to flying hook if he needs to counter throwers. When playing him, charger super quickly because once he has it, he is safe. You don't need to worry about matchups much because he is good into anything due to his versatile kit. B is the sixth best brawler. Be has been at the top of the meta ever since her gadget rework. She is one of the best rank counters in the game thanks to her high damage and slowing abilities. Her very long range makes very good on open maps. Bees super shoots out a swarm of bees that slow enemies. This is best to help you land more shots and to force the enemies into uncomfortable positions. When playing B, make sure to keep some distance from the enemy so you can deal high damage without being threatened. Keep spamming your rattled hive gadget because it instantly gives you complete control. When though be is very good against tanks, she doesn't do well against assassins because they can quickly burst her down. So, pair B with a high DPS brawler to solve that. Chester is the fifth best brawler. Chester did receive and another nerf to his hypercharge in the update, but it is still so strong. He can still charge it up against tanks, and once he has it, it's a free team wipe. Chester does a lot of damage to deal with tanky compositions, and he has five different supers, which make him a versatile brawler. These supers are in random order, and the opponents don't know which super you have, which allows you to surprise them. Chester is good on fast-paced game modes like Brawl Ball and Gem Grab. His high damage allow him to effectively shut down tanks and assassins and make gamechanging plays. Don't play him on long range maps since he doesn't have the abilities to complete with snipers. Ali is the fourth best brawler. Ali is a versatile tank that is good in many situations. Ali deals a lot of damage and his super is very good at getting him and his teammates kills. His super is fundamentally broken and his jump gadget is very useful counter throwers. Ali doesn't have many counters apart from long damage brawlers, so he can be used in many situations. When playing Ali, feel free to play aggressive and dash in because you have enough health to last until the super is activated. Just don't play him on open maps because brawlers like B and Lou and effectively shut him down. Other than that, his dash, jump, and high damage make him good everywhere. Hank is the third best brawler in Brawl Stars. Even after his hypercharge nerf, his damage and survival abilities make him a very strong brawler. Hank's main attacks blows a bubbly that gets bigger over time, and it can go through walls. This is very strong for pressuring the enemy and forcing them back. His supers shoots torpedoes in all directions, dealing damage and healing at the same time. He was used so much in the recent monthly finals and didn't receive any nerfs when playing Hank charger super ASAP because once you have it, it will be very hard for the enemy to kill you. Hanks is good on maps. Will walls because he can hit enemies through then, but he can also be good on open maps because of his hypercharge. His bubble covers a large area, so use it to pressure the enemy and control the map. Lumi is the second best brawler in Brawl Stars. Lumi received two small nerds that didn't do much. She was also the most banned brawler in monthly finals. Lumi is so good because of her versatility. You can use her attacks to control areas on map and dictate play. Her super is also very good in shutting down aggression and confirming easy kills. Her gadgets and star powers are also very strong. Lumi is good on pretty much every mode, but don't always pick her in knockout and bounty. And Kenji is the best brawler in Brawl Stars. Kenji recently received his hypercharge and it is completely broken. Even if you don't kill the enemy with the hypercharge super, you spawn right on them and then finish them off easily. Kenji's main attack does a lot of damage and you can use it to dash to the enemy and chase them. His survivability is also insane because he heals up whenever he deals damage. When playing Kenji, you want to play very aggressive to charge your hypercharge quicker. target low DPS brawlers because Kenji plays well into them. Kenji is best on fast-paced modes because he can cycle his supers and hypercharges easily. These modes are Brawl Ball, Hot Zone, and Gem Grab. Kenji is an insane brawler right now and definitely the best in the game. And that is the 10 best brawlers in Brawl Stars. Make sure to like and subscribe and watch this video right here where I rank every hypercharge. Thanks for watching and I'll see you"

    "creator": "kENoX",
    "transcript": "Este Brawler está rotísimo en Brawl Stars y nadie se está quejando al respecto. Todos los personajes cuando salen siempre están rotos, pero claro, tiene sus excepciones. Pero Kenji desde que salió estuvo roto y sigue estando roto. ¿O acaso tú crees normal que ya estando a punto de morir se haya podido curar lo suficiente para aguantar y podrá hacerse una doble? No creo también este don que tienen personajes como Bibi o Nita, donde puedes atravesar muros, atravesar en sí, no, pero me entiend Stars en vez de nerfear lo que hace, le da una temática propia, un evento propio, una esposa, una hipercarga y skin de hipercarga. Okay."
