    "creator": "CryingMan",
    "transcript": "The 10 best brawler since season 38. The 10th best brawler right now is Lily. Yeah, Lily is finally in the meta. I mean, she's been pretty decent even before the hypercharge got released. But yeah, now she's easily top 10. Watch this do super. Okay, thank you for the free super. The good thing about Lily is that you can play Lily in any mode. You can play in Brawl Ball, bounty, knock out, like gem grab, doesn't matter. Um, just going to use my super cuz they use all the ammo and they're kind of low HP. Good super by Fang. I can just walk in. And you guys can see I already got my hypercharge. So like it's just so easy to get a hypercharge back. Now I can just use my gadget and just use my hypercharge. All right, that was not the best hypercharge, but uh yeah, at least the prem is kind of low. And now I'm going to be kind of useless until I get the super back or the gadget. So yeah, this is the only bad thing about Lily. Like you can't miss a super or the gadget. You're basically going to become an achar. Okay. All right. Pretty good defense by my team. I just got to get my super and just Yeah. Get a kill. Just so good, bro. Like, got to watch out the primo hypercharge. Just going to use my gadget just to make sure I stay alive. Good hypercharge by Aker. All right. Nobody saw that. But now I can score it with my hypercharge pack. Just so good. I definitely recommend you guys to max out. The ninth best brawler right now is Ali. Yeah, I'm going to play in duels cuz my aliies have like 200 trophies, but we're facing RT. Should be an easy matchup. I'm just going to go up, use my gadget and easy kill. I mean, Ali used to be like easily top three, but now she kind of I mean, he kind of got like fell off. Not because like Ali sucks, but now there's just so many better brawlers to play. Okay, so Gail got a super. So, what I can do now is just use my super and the gadget. Like this combo doesn't get countered unless you play like Poco or Frank. Nah, bro. Like, this got to be a rage bait. All good. Just going to get a super and yeah, there's just no way this guy can kill me. Just going to Yeah, use the super to the wall. And this guy can't really do anything, bro. Going to use my gadget just in case cuz I have an infinite gadget, too. And now we're facing Lily. This guy can't deal enough damage to kill me. So, I can just go up, take the shot. There's nothing this guy can do unless he has a hypercharge and like be the best Lily in the world. Okay. He's going to miss a gadget, too. I mean, the super. Uh, just let it go, bro. Like, you're not going to win. Is it going right or left, right, going left? He got a super, but I can just, you know, get close, bro. Let it go. Let it go, bro. Yeah, Ali is still really solid. Like, easily top three tank in the current meta. The eighth best brawler right now is Carl. Yeah, he's still a very solid brawler. You can't really go wrong with this pick. Um, okay. We hit the cold. Just going to use my gadget. The lobster should be dead. Okay, good pinch. I mean, you can't really first pick every single time cuz you can easily get countered by like Chester or some tanky brawlers, you know. Uh, I'm just going to put the ball and use my super. All right. See, like he's still very good. Got my hypercharge as well and the gadget. Just so much versatility, you know. Uh, now there's so many things I can do. Just got to watch out the kiss super. Going to use my gadget. Yeah, he should be dead. And now I can just use the super tank some shot. Like doesn't matter, bro. The hypercharge super is so good, bro. I literally carried. He's so good still. Yeah, he's still very decent. So, definitely consider maxing out. The seventh best brawler right now is Melody. Oh, by the way, huge shout out to second for, you know, helping me making the tier list. He told me to like put Kaz instead of Melody, but bro, like Kaz is not released. So yeah, melody is just so good. You can play in any mode. Definitely a high skill kit brawler. So you got to be good at the game to play this brawler. Let me see. Uh just going to use my gadget. Free kill. Now I can go for tech and this guy should be dead. Like look at this. Just so good if you know what to play. Uh but yeah, let me see. Just going to get my notes from the tester. Uh hopefully I can get a kill. Yep. Okay, so now we have one super left. H got to watch out the B super. Okay, this should be a free kill. Um, okay, we might get pinched. Relax, bro. Relax. Oh my god. Please, please. This guy really wanted to kill me, but now I got a hypercharge. I have only one super left, so I'm just going to use it. Um, yeah, this guy can kill me, bro. I know what you're doing, bro. Oh, okay. Goodbye. And now I'm going to hypercharge. Let me see. Okay, Primo is here. Like, let it go, bro. Mele is so good. I don't know why I'm playing in spinny mode, but free win. But yeah, definitely solid brawler, so consider mixing up. The sixth best brawler right now is Hank. Yeah, Hank is back in the meta. Like, so good. It's just so hard to counter him, bro. All you got to do is just regen, go up, tank some shot, and you can instantly deal like 4.2k 2k damage and once you get a super you can just heal up like watch this. Yeah, I think it's currently the best tank unless you like consider Kenji is the best tank. Like you just got to go up and they got to like retreat. You got to make sure you aim first and then use the hypercharge to get the maximum value now. Got to hit a shot. Use the super to regen like and now I just got to bait the terra super. I knew he was going to do that. And yeah, I know him says a gadget but doesn't matter. I have so much HP to get the he up in. I mean, you need to kind of practice to be a good Hank, but yeah, still just max out. The fifth best brawler right now is Mele. Yeah, another one of the new brawlers, so I have to play in duels cuz I don't push new brawlers. Uh, did I get him or no? I don't think so. Oh, wait. Okay, relax. Oh my god. All right. But yeah, me is so good. You can play in any mode. Like, just so easy to hit a shot. You can basically auto aim. Yeah, this should be a Okay, goodbye. You can play in any mode. You can play against the any matchup. Like, just so good. Oh my god. Okay, this is kind of cool interaction. Just look at this. Oh, look at this. All right. Um, got to watch the fing shot. Fin is lowkey good, too. I don't know if I got him or not. I don't think so. Um, okay. Nope. Just going to get a super and use my gadget. Uh, okay. Now I got a super back. Just got to wait for my gadget and this should be GG. Give me the gadget. Okay, now I can use the gadget. Oh my god, this is so toxic. Yeah, easily one of the best brawlers. So definitely consider maxing out. For number four, we got Cryman. N spent n Jong. I see so many comments where like people saying Jayong is spend LC and I know like seconds saying like Jayong is crying mean like kind of relax on us but look at this. Yeah, I told you in the Jayong video that he's going to be one of the best brawers. Like I think the most broken thing about Jayong is that you can basically get a permanent speed buff. Like every time you hit someone, not hit someone, every time you use the main attack like so stupid. I mean I love this brawler, bro. Not because like people saying Jong is basically crying man when he quits YouTube, but yeah, I'm going to just use my damage gadget. 2.3k is pretty slow, too. All right, goodbye. It's just so hard to like dodge a shot. Like his shot is impossible to dodge and like I don't know, man. Just so good. Definitely max out. The third best brother right now is Chester. I mean, yeah, you guys all know like he got nerfed or she got nerfed. I forgot his gender, her gender, but yeah, his hypercharge is just so good still. It's just it deals way too much damage. Dude, their comp is so weird. Like Jackie Pokemon max. That's going to be like 2022 comp. Uh we can look just do this. Oh my god, this Jackie got a super. Maybe I should have just walk in, but I think like Jackie knows how to like save the goal. Okay, good play by Mortis. All right, Rico is going to go down. I got a bomb super, so I'm just going to use the super on the Jackie and the Poco. Pretty good. And I got a super back. Uh, we can definitely defend, right? Keep the distance. All right. And now I got a hypercharge. I know Poco is here. All right. Just going to get a super back and we should be fine. Uh, going to use my hypercharge and get close. Going to use it on the Jackie. And I hit the max as well. That poison damage can do like 5k damage. It's kind of stupid, bro. But yeah, just walk in. Look at this mortise. All right, I got my bomb super back. So hopefully can defend this is yeah too much HP honestly. Uh I think we're cooked. There's just no way we can defend this rip. But you guys can see I almost got my hypercharge back. So we just got to defend and we should be good. Yeah, got my hypercharge and just go up. Tank some shot. The hypercharge. So broken. Yeah, I don't think Chester is going to get nerfed again. So highly recommend you guys to mix up. The second best brawler right now is Lumi. Yeah, another new brawler that I didn't even push. Like I don't really push like the trophies mode. You guys all know like she can deal insane amount of damage. Just so hard to like push against the Lumi. Like she has so much area control. This Leon is kind of slimy though. Uh bro, like are you going to wait for the smoke? All right, just got to wait for the gadget. And yeah, I don't know what this guy's doing honestly, but now we can just place the gadget. All right. Not the best gadget, but all good. Hopefully, bro. All good. We slow him down. Yeah. Goodbye. Hey, Lumi always gets banned at high rank. It's always like Lumi, like Kenji, sometimes Ali. Uh, yeah, he should be dead. Like, look at the damage. But yeah, low key like Daryl can counter me if he just used the super on me. But I don't think this guy's good at the game. Like, what are you doing, bro? Okay, we hit the Daryl again. Yeah, this guy's doesn't know what he's doing right now. Like, but yeah, definitely makes out. She's just insane. The best brother right now is this dog. Yeah, the reason why Kenji is so good right now, you guys all know he's hypercharged. Like, it just doesn't make sense, bro. I've never seen more broken hypercharge than this. Like, Supercell, you got to do something about this. Seriously, it's just so damn horrendous, bro. Uh, got to watch out the post super though. All right. Um, okay. Not looking too good. They might score. All right. He's going to use the super ripe, but you know what? It doesn't matter, actually. Like, I'm just going to use my hypercharge. Goodbye. Game over. Like, what are we doing? Supercell. Seriously, like, what are we doing? Like, this should never happen, bro. They got to nerf it before the the Brawl Cup or something. Unfortunately, they released the new hypercharges for Grief, Amber, and Willow right after I recorded. So, let me just share my thoughts really quick whether they're going to be in top 10 or not. All right, so first we got Amber. She's 100% going to be in top 10. She's insane. Her hypercharge has crazy team wide potential. She was already a decent brawler and now with the hypercharge, she's going to be like easily top five brawler. Next, we got Grief. Yeah, Grief is also going to be insane. He's going to be a complete aggro counter. His hypercharge has insane myite potential. Like, you just can't do anything against this. He also is a wall break gadget, so you can pretty much play him in any mode. Yeah, he's going to be at least in top 10 if not in top five. Lastly, we got Willow. I mean, Willow is okay, too, but I don't think she's a top 10 candidate. Her hypercharge isn't anything crazy, but you can still kind of use it in more aggressive way. Now, it's going to be kind of tricky to play any aggressive brawlers into Willow cuz I think Willow hypercharge can kind of counter the assassin to send any aggressive brawlers. So, we got to wait and see how she plays out. But for now, I'll probably put her in top 20. Anyways, I'm going to make a video about each hypercharge pretty soon, so stay tuned, subscribe. Thank you guys for all the support, and I'll see you guys pretty soon."

    "creator": "KairosTime Gaming",
    "transcript": "version 45 of the competitive Brawl Stars tier list. It's here. It's now. You guys know the deal here. We're going to rank every brawler from worst to best and compare them to how they were in the previous update. And this video was made in help or coordination with all of these pro players here. I did not make this tier list. I had zero input in this tier list, which you will see when we get to Griff when I adamantly disagree with the pros. But in the end, I know they're better than me. But this tier list does come with a massive disclaimer. Okay, this update, Supercell did something a little bit weird with Hypercharge releases, and they decided to release one the first week, three or three or four the next week, and they're just releasing them slower than I normally would expect. So, in order for me to get you this tier list and for it to be like as accurate as possible, I would have had to have waited for like 4 weeks for the pros to actually like really decide where the meta is. You guys don't want to wait 4 weeks. So, a lot of the hypercharges have not been included in consideration for this video. So, keep that in mind because it's not like I talked to the pros yesterday. It takes a long time to gather all our feedback and put it together. So anyway, let's get into this. Doug is kicking us off at the bottom of the F tier. Worst of the worst, bottom of the bunch. Sorry. Um, anyway, he didn't receive any changes this update. He is still the worst brawler in the game. We've got more to cover, but I want to give a huge thank you to repeat.gg for sponsoring today's video. And this is actually like legit. Like, this is a good one. I mean, all my sponsors are great ones, but this has specifically to do with Brawl Stars.

Bull has moved from the Dtier down into the F tier. The overall tank meta is a little bit weaker than before, but Bull was definitely one of the tanks that was hurt a lot from the meta shift. Now, there's just really not a good reason to play him. Clansancy is moving from the Ctier down into the F tier. Clansancy is one of the brawlers who is probably way better than what he's currently ranked at because his hypercharge is going to be released. Without it, though, it is unplayable or he's unplayable. So, just keep him in mind though once the Oh, wait. Hypercharge is already out by the time I'm actually recording this, but the pros haven't had time to actually decide placement. So anyway, Rosa's moving from the B tier down into the F tier. Similar to Bull, no changes were made to Rosa, but she was hurt a lot more than any other tank in the game by how the meta has changed. Time for the Dtier. These brawlers suck still, just not as much as the Ftier brawlers. Oh my gosh, Jesse's moved from the Ctier down to the Dtier. She actually receives a small buff to her health, but she still has very underwhelming damage. There just isn't a good reason to use her over many other brawlers. Even in heist, if all the meta brawlers are banned, then yeah, you could probably play Jesse. Not at the most competitive level, though. Edgar is staying in the D tier. Lots of brawlers were affected by emergency balance changes that shortly came out after gadget the gadgets were reworked, and Edgar's gadgets were both nerfed, so he's actually slightly worse than he was before. Chuck has moved from the Ctier down into the D tier. Even though Chuck is actually still really good in heist after the rework, there's basically no other use for him right now. I see some people try and make him work out in hot zone. Honestly, even there there are just better options. Colt has moved from the Ctier down into the Dtier. He didn't receive any buffs and just like Jesse, he is getting power crept every update as well. Fang is moving from the C tier down into the D tier. Too many of Fang's counters are higher up in the meta right now and there are several assassins to use that are just much better than him at the moment. BB is moving from the Ctier down to the Dtier. BB is just another close-range brawler that is particularly struggling right now and did not get any buffs this update. Sam is moving from the Ctier down to the D tier. I guess Sam's hypercharge really was overrated because as soon as it was released, he he hasn't been used like hardly at all. Shel's moving from the C tier down to the D tier. Since tanks aren't being used quite as much right now, Shelly is also being used less since she's really only good for countering them. Okay, now we have the Ctier brawlers. These ones aren't quite competitive. There may be some very small situations where the pros might use them, but they're not played nearly as often as the rest of the brawlers in the game. Dynamite has moved from the B tier down into the C tier. Dude, I'm getting hit so hard this update. My skin locked account, like almost all of my brawlers are C tier and below. It's rough. Lots of throwers are actually hurting in this meta because a lot of the more aggressive brawlers are at the top of the meta and Dynamite is probably like the hardest shot to land out of all of them, especially against fastoving targets. So, he's struggling. Lily is staying in the C tier. She's another brawler who's getting a hypercharge and so she might be a lot better than she like was, but for now she is a below average assassin. Gail is staying in the C tier. Very similar to Shel. There's not a huge need for Gail right now since tanks aren't being used as much. So, he's in the C tier. Griff is moving from the A tier down into the C tier. H, you know, and like I disagree with the pros, but at the same time, I am really feeling it. Griff has been affected by the meta has changed in a big way, but he is also getting a hypercharge, which I think is one of the better ones this update. I can almost guarantee he's going to rank a lot higher than like middle or low C tier, but if it's I don't know if it's going to bring him all the way back up to the A tier. We'll have to see. I still like Griff, which is funny because when he released, I really didn't like him. There's just something about his play style I just really like. Nani is staying in the C tier. Nani deals plenty of damage, but her shots are just really, really hard to land, especially against a lot of the top brawlers that have high mobility. El Primo was moving from the Btier down into the C tier. He didn't receive any balance changes, but there are much better options for closerange brawlers right now. Draco, hey, is moving down to the C tier. Hey, Draco plays particularly well with certain support brawlers, and even those brawlers aren't quite as good as before. So, Draco is being used even less. Serge has moved from the A tier down into the C tier. I have no issues with this. I hate playing against Serge. Serge was another really good brawler in like to play against close-range brawlers, but because closerange brawlers are being used less, he is really struggling up like to keep up with them. So, I mean, I'm fine with less surge for real. Rust has moved from the B tier down into the C tier. Russ is very dependent on what which other brawlers are actually being good and a lot of the brawlers that he typically is paired well with aren't being played at the moment. And additionally, the map pool right now doesn't really favor his bounce shots. So, there's not a lot of good reasons to use him right now. Brock has moved from the B tier down to the Ctier. Brock's biggest weakness is how easy his shots are to dodge against high mobility brawlers, and this meta is particularly bad for him. Eve is moving from the Btier down to the C tier. Eve is only really good against certain brawlers, and there are lots of decent brawlers that can pierce through her hatchlings, so she's just not as good as other longrange brawlers are. Miko is staying in the C tier. Miko received a small buff to his reload speed, but it hasn't really changed the way that he's being played at all. So, he's in the C tier still. Grom is staying in the C tier. Grom is the second thrower on our list whose attacks are relatively easy to dodge, so he's struggling in this meta even despite recently gaining a hypercharge. Sprout has moved from the A tier down into the C tier. Sprout's attacks actually can be hard to avoid, but it really depends on the map, and the current map pool just isn't very good for bounce shots, so Sprout struggles. M is staying in this C tier. I lost the F tier, just a sec. M is actually slightly better than before, but still doesn't play well against brawlers that can easily get close to her. So, she's struggling. And now we have the Btier brawlers. These brawlers are actually competitive. They're typically only good in the right maps or modes with the right teammates or to counter specific brawlers or they're just like generally good enough to play. They're not as good as the A tier or S tier brawlers at the moment though. Starting us off, we have Penny moving from the A tier down to the B tier. Penny is a pretty map dependent brawler and there aren't many maps and matchups where she can easily protect her cannon. So, she's not a top brawler for the moment. Nita is moving from the A tier down to the B tier. Nidita was a really good choice against a lot of like good tanks last update, but now they're being used a lot less and Nidita is as well. Otis is staying in the B tier. He actually was never a really like a great brawler except for when he was first released, but because of his range, his damage, and his super, he's never like a bad brawler. Sandy is staying in the B tier. Sy's super is strong enough to make him at least an average brawler, but his damage output isn't quite enough to keep up with the current meta. Leon is staying in the B tier. Leon's actually really good, but only if he is against brawlers that don't have attacks that can easily reveal his location or brawlers that have enough health that they cannot be assassinated quickly. Colette is moving from the A tier down to the B tier. She's just another great tank counter that has gone down an entire tier simply because of those tanks not being played as much. RT is staying in the B tier. Very similar to Otis. RT has the stats to always be a decently safe choice on almost any map, but doesn't really dominate any aspect or individual aspect of the game. Maisie is moving from the A tier down to the B tier. She's actually still a decent brawler, but she's also a great counter to close-range brawlers, which aren't as powerful right now. 8bit's moving from the A tier down to the B tier. 8bit is only good on certain maps and only with certain brawlers on his team. And while he was really good last update, he's being used a lot less right now. Byron is staying in the B tier. Many of the brawlers that Byron was being used to support have fallen down in the meta and so Byron consequently has also fallen down a little bit. Pearl is staying in the Btier. No changes were made to Pearl this update. She's exactly where she was in the last update. Spike is staying in the B tier. Spike also didn't receive any balance changes this update and he's honestly being used slightly less than before despite being one of the free brawlers to play every uh or you know well anyway the free brawler really doesn't impact the competitive meta like at all. So it doesn't really matter. Charlie is moving from the D tier up into the B tier. Charlie actually had a pretty big buff in the update before this one. And while she's not broken like she used to be. Uh she's actually being played quite a bit now. Buzz is staying in the B tier despite many of the close-range brawlers struggling in this meta. Buzz is actually still a pretty solid assassin. Cordelius is staying in the B tier. Cordelius actually didn't receive any balance changes, but this current map pool is just a just favors him a little bit better. So, I mean, still Btier, but a little bit better. Tick is staying in the B tier. Even though Tick is the most fragile brawler in the game, he's usually a decent thrower just because of how well he can deal damage with close-range brawlers as a thrower and also how consistently he can deal damage from a distance. Willow is moving from the Ctier up into the B tier. Willow received a buff to her health and she's receiving her hypercharge soon, so she's probably going to be even stronger than she is right now. Larry and Larry are moving from the A tier down into the B tier. Very similar to Tick. Larry is a solid thrower because he's actually pretty good against close-range brawlers, but Guju kind of just does everything that he can except better. So, Larry and Li is not being played as much. Jackie is maybe from the C tier up into the B tier. Somehow, Jackie is actually being playing being played more in this meta. And a lot of it has to do with how many of the maps she's really good on are in the current map pool for ranked. Crow is staying in the B tier. Crow receives a buff to the anti-healing effect from his attacks. And while he is definitely stronger than before, he's still not quite an A tier brawler. Terra is staying in the B tier. Nothing changed for Terara. She's basically just as good as she was in the last update. Poco is moving from the S tier down into the B tier. Poco is just insane right after the gadget rework happened. So now that the cooldowns are longer, he's not nearly as good. Mandy is moving from the A tier down into the B tier. Mandy received a slight nerf to her hypercharge rate, but actually brought her down an entire tier now that she's not charging it as much, which I have no issues with because I really don't like playing against Mandy. Piper is staying in the B tier. Piper's all she's probably always going to be a really solid sharpshooter. But in this meta, sharpshooters are struggling to hit shots at max distance, so Piper's not as good as she usually is. Belle is staying in the B tier. Basically, the same thing can be said about Belle, except that she deals more damage at close range, so than Piper does. So, she's actually slightly more usable than Piper, but not by much. Shade is moving from the C tier up into the B tier. Shade is pretty much useless on maps that don't have a ton of walls, but there seem to be a lot of maps with a lot of walls right now, so he's actually being played a lot. Mortise is staying in the B tier. Mortise didn't receive any balance changes, but he is being played just slightly more than before. Daryl's moving from the A tier down to the B tier. Daryl is a great assassin in a lot of situations, but like most tanks, he's getting countered more often in this update. So, not quite as good as before, but still playable. Mo is moving from the D tier up into the B tier. Mo actually got a buff to his reload speed in the update before this one. And then his super got reworked, so he's actually playable now. Kind of funny how just being able to adjust the distance of your super actually makes a big difference for a brawler like Mo. Gus has moved from the A tier down into the B tier. Gus has had a few nerfs in the last few updates, but he's one of the brawlers getting his hypercharge, so I wouldn't be surprised at all if he quickly moved back up into the A tier. So just keep that in mind. Rico is moving from the A tier down into the B tier. Another brawler that I am so glad to be seeing less of. Rico is very map dependent and he dominates on the maps that he's good on, but they're just aren't as many of those in the map pool right now, which is great because that means I don't have to ban Rico as frequently. Okay, now we get to talk about the A tier brawlers. These ones are a lot more useful in a lot more situations than the Btier brawlers. They're just not quite as good as the S tier brawlers, which are good like everywhere. Kit is staying in the A tier. Kit is pretty good on his own for a support brawler, and if his opponents don't specifically counter him, he can create some very easy wins for his team. Frank is staying in the A tier. Frank is slightly worse than before, but he's actually managed to remain in the A tier because he has so much health that your opponents have to draft around picking a brawler that can actually deal with Frank. So, he forces some interesting situations. Barry's moving from the S tier down into the A tier. Barry actually received a nerf to his healing a while ago and now that the brawlers that he supports aren't as good, he's not being played as much, but he's still a great A tier brawler. B is staying in the A tier. She received a nerf to her rattled hive gadget, and while she's not an A tier brawler, she's not quite as strong as before. Barley is staying in the A tier. Barley's just one of the best brawlers in the game that you can use if nobody on the map can break walls, so that's why he's there. Meg is moving from the D tier all the way up into the A tier. I'm not excited to see me being played more. She received her hypercharge after I made the last tier list, and it has made a huge difference for her. Plus, she got a movement speed buff to her while she's outside of her mecca, making her even easier to dodge shots. Ash is staying in the A tier. No changes were made to Ash this update, and he's just a little worse than before because of the current meta. Max is staying in the A tier. Max is another brawler that is usually good at supporting close-range brawlers, so she's being played slightly less, but she's still good. Ham is moving from the F tier all the way up into the A tier. She actually received a damage buff that also charges her super faster and now she is way better than before. She still also has not received her hypercharge yet which will make her even better. Lola is moving from the B tier up into the A tier. She received her hypercharge in the previous update and her stats are just so good that you really can't go wrong with her. Janet is moving from the S tier down to the A tier. Jan received a nerf to her hypercharge rate in the previous update. And now she can't cycle through her supers like she could before, but she's still a really great option. Amber is staying in the A tier. She is actually going to receive her hypercharges update, and she's still a solid A tier brawler without it, so she really just might be broken soon. Consider her for an S tier placement. Allie's moving from the S tier down to the A tier. Allie's had a few nerfs over the last few balance changes, and his lower survivability finally knocked him out of the S tier, but he's still in the A tier. He's still great. A great choice. Fin is moving from the B tier up into the A tier. Fin got a few major buffs in the previous update and he went from being a below average brawler to a really good brawler on most maps. Squeak is moving from the Btier up into the A tier. Squeak's actually been really good ever since the gadget rework. And even though he didn't get any buffs this update, the meta has shifted to be good for him in his favor along with some of the maps where there's a lot of choke points that Squeak can really take advantage of. Gan is staying in the A tier. Gen didn't receive any balance changes this update and he's still just being used on the same maps for the same reasons. Mr. P is moving from the S tier down into the A tier. Mr. P got nerfed quite a bit in the previous update since his hypercharge honestly just broke the game, but it's actually still pretty strong. Gray is staying in the A tier. Gray is one of the safest choices on almost any map because of how many brawlers he counters and how well he supports his teammates. Honestly, I don't want to see much more people playing Gray because he's actually really annoying to play around. Bonnie is moving from the F tier all the way up into the A tier. Bonnie received a rework to her super so that she can climb back into her cannon as soon as she wants. And even though she still doesn't have a hypercharge, this rework instantly made her a very good brawler, which is crazy. Lou is staying in the A tier. No changes were made to Lou this update and he's right where he was on the last tier list. Juju is staying in the A tier. She's still the best thrower in the game, but even she is somewhat map dependent and will actually lose to other throwers depending on the map. Buster's moving from the B tier up into the A tier. He received his hypercharge in the previous update and he actually got nerfed this update, but I guess his hypercharge made him so strong that he's still an A tier brawler. B is moving from the B tier up into the A tier. B is another brawler that received his hypercharge in the previous update and it made a huge difference for him. Melody is staying in the A tier. She actually didn't receive any balance changes this update and she's still one of the best aggressive brawlers in the game. Stu is moving from the S tier down into the A tier. Stu was broken in the previous update, mainly because of his speed zone gadget. And since it's been nerfed, he's not quite as good. Jay Young is starting in the A tier. Since the update's balance changes were a little delayed, we've actually been able to test out Jay Young quite a bit so far, and the pros agree that he is at least A tier. Mele is staying in the A tier. Mele received a very slight buff to his reload speed in the previous update, and I guess that's all it took to make him one of the best brawlers in the game. Angelo is staying in the A tier. Angelo remains the best sharpshooter in the game and probably could be considered S tier on certain maps where hovering over water makes a big difference, but overall he's not quite good enough for S tier. So, let's talk about the S tier brawlers. The best of the best, the band of the band. Carl is moving from the B tier all the way up into the S tier. He received his hypercharge in the previous update, and that combined with the recent gadget rework has quickly made him one of the most solid choices in the game on any map. Kaz is starting out her debut in the S tier. Now, Ka is the only brother on this on this tier list that has not been released at the time that I recorded this video, but she already has two different hypercharges, and I just don't have any reason to believe that she will not be S tier. So, I lied when I said that I didn't help with this tier list. I'm helping with Kaz, and that's it. But, I think she's going to be busted. Chester is moving from the C tier up into the S tier. Chester received his hypercharge in the previous update and it's so strong that it was the only thing that brought Chester from the C tier to being one of the best brawlers in the game. Hank is staying in the S tier. I know that people are not going to believe me and you're going to think I'm crazy, but the pros agree that Hank is one of the best brawlers in the game. He has only been nerfed since his hypercharge has released and he's still the best tank in the game by far, especially with the current map pool where there's a lot of walls for him to really play around. Lumi is moving from the A tier up into the S tier. Lumi actually was not released at the time that I made the previous tier list. And since she's only been nerfed, and she's still almost the best brawler in the game, I can see how you can see how strong she actually is. But she's not the best. That is deserved for our final brawler. Kenji is moving up from the A tier into the S tier as the best brawler in the game. Kenji is the only brawler who had his hypercharge this update when I reached out to the pros and it is easily the strongest hypercharge in the game and has made Kenji completely broken. And that right there is the competitive tier list. I wish that I could give you something that is currently perfectly accurate with all the brawlers that actively have hypercharges right now, but it just takes too long for me to make this video because I take so much time and effort to reach out to the pro players, take their feedback, put it all together into the the tier list, and then it also takes time to film, record, gather all the footage, send it to my editor. Like, it takes time to make these videos. So, I'm really sorry, but massive thank you to these pro players for helping out. I still think that this is a very accurate tier list with a few changes that will happen as brawlers do receive their hypercharges. I want to know what you guys think. So, let me know in the comment section below who your favorite brawler to play is right now and who you just hate playing against. For now, this is Kyos ticking by. We will see you in the next video."

    "creator": "HMBLE",
    "transcript": "Sencio, welcome to a brand new humble video where boss and me are going to do a brand new tier list of this weather. Let's go. Um, so we choose this type of format where you have like icons are different. Um, I like personally more. Uh, let's see what we do with categories. But first of all, this slightly here. Let's just cut it off. It's D or E. No, like we never use and average. Not played a lot. It's like last option as nutty tank. Uh, Nita for me is like average or B. Yeah. For now, I will leave it C. Same same. It's only like drile counter apparently in this meta. It's pretty hard to play. Cold is only high. So, where do you put him? I would put it C. Sure. It's literally only high. We just can't move it then. Uh, bull is on average for me. Maybe even we uh Brock forget change. I will put I'm fine with I was going to put it be, but it just has so many contests. Yeah, two too different people for Primo above average for me. Yeah, it's me I think already. Yeah, I think it's pretty strong with the iPad and it's used a lot. I'm down for that. Also, Barry counter now that Barry came back. Didn't matter. He came back from it as well, especially like during deals. Um, Poco for me is a high A. Same same. Rosa is E. Yeah, Jess is D. Jess is D. Can be used sometimes, but we never do. Dynam, I will put it B. B. He's not that much use as partly because every Yeah, we have we have Jay Young as well which is like really speed meta. Okay, so I'm fine with that. Thick I don't know. We haven't played him in so long though. I will put it just B or C. No, we'll see. I will put it C. All right, I will put him top of C. Um A bit. A bit I think it's C C. He's getting played more than Tik Tok. I think it will be he's getting picked around with dynamite in my opinion for me be like really good gem carry really good genie counter as well for knockout for out the map uh generally gem carry nice I think it's fine now ro CB B I think can be used sometimes but not that much so yeah D for me is B or A especially heist is so broken I mean he's broken in heist is a buster counter that is top tier too so I will put it a low A for now even there for now uh Penn is like under Yeah, it's perfect category for her. Jackie is like B for me. Be high. Be high. I think even A, but not for now. Yeah, it depends. People force her too much. They just play into everything, but you can only play against other tanks like Buster, which is like prime jacking match up or like Barry. Gash has a sniper just now. Uh, we're playing it a lot though. We have like sniper maps to lock right now. I think it's at least B. Yeah, it's B 100%. Put them a bit higher. It's always like one of the best times you can go both A or S. of a high, but let's see how many boards we have on. We will change it later. Don't worry. Uh M is like under average. Yeah, not good. It's fine. Sometimes against pogo comps, poker tanks comps, but just only against pogo. Yeah, that's it. Um it's too I mean we didn't take a lot. Yeah, the the hypercharge level was actually a bit too much I think. So I don't know. I would hit B high for now. Yeah, we can change it. Uh Piper, uh I will go with say low. Yeah, low A is basic. Pam for hypercharge. That's an interesting one. I honestly we didn't test out. She also got the damage buff. We didn't play her too much. But the hypercharge isn't in the game yet. It's going to come out in the future, which is quite sad. So, don't know yet. Yeah, it's not out yet. I think hyp she can be quite strong. But right now, she's average for me. Yeah, for now it's C. But that will with hyper will be. Yeah, with hyper she at least. Frank for me is B or A. Like really nice tank. Yeah, she's a really nice tank. She can call tank if you go. Maybe it's D. B, you think? Yeah. Okay. I'll put it a too, but for now leave it. For now, leave it as uh I need B. Yeah, I'm fine with that. It's probably a bit lower. Yeah, just cont. No, I mean can be used though. What do we use him? What do we play last time? Except pit stop. Except pit stop. That is not I mean against against throwers. Never mind. We don't go. Never mind. No, not the easy way to work. Okay. Okay. Um card for me is A or B. A. For me, it's A. Okay. Low A. I think the tanks are a bit too annoying for me. Only hung though. Griff hyper. We broken hyper. It's not going to get a lot of value if you don't face tanks. Above average for sure. I don't know if he's A or not. Uh no, it's B. Okay. Uh he got an hyper and he still isn't getting picked. So like under average I don't know. You choose. I I think under average like he got hyper. It's only possible pick on knockout against a sprout. That's the only way I would pick him currently. Bonnie is an interesting one. I think new mechanic. I think she's average nowadays. She can be put the T. I will put the T. Yeah, it's like before cold I think. Um, same for G honestly. Yeah, I agree. Colette even weaker heist change honestly. Like we literally had a scrim hypercharge did like half the damage which is crazy. I think it's C. Yeah. Yeah. Uh, Bell is A for me. Really strong A. Banger sniper like always always there. Ash is really good hand counter. Really good counter. High B or a low high B for now. Yeah, same. Um, it's again B. Yeah, high B. Yeah, some E. hypert got destroyed. Yeah. So much but even then without like you always feed enemies and especially now for hyper charge meta you're basically running them down and giving them hype for free for free and that's not what you want. Many for me is A. I will put a B though. You put a B or let's give a top for B for now. Um I'm I'm going to um I will put a D. You put a D. Yeah. Okay. Let's leave a D. We have F. We should have stop. Yeah. Yeah. Top. He just runs it down all the time. Hyper to heal his shield. It's just too annoying with possible synergies we have from him with poke with barrier comps. It's just too much. Max Jay Young everything. Uh Pearl is an interesting one. I don't know. Below or C high below them. Larry is not picked a lot but it's not that bad. But it's like this. It's B. It's okay. Angelo. O I will put it as honestly. Every sniper map you use and for every everyone even when I cover canyons. Okay. Barry is S in my opinion. I will put it today. Uh A I think yes. I mean it has a lot of countries though. I mean but not B doesn't count. What what does it counter? Lou L Hank. Not Hank. No. Yeah. I disagree because if you if they go Hank, you go Barry Frank and you win. I disagree. Okay, just leave it then. But I will put A. Sh again. Kia. Nice assassin. Me got nerfed a lot. Um it's only the gadget. I think C. I'm fine with C. Going to put him double C. It's only the gadget that as well. Your Mortis is really situational. Yeah, if you have an IP, you're going to kill them. It's going to be useless. Enough of B. Yeah, like that. Uh paid way more. Yeah, above average. Okay, I'm fine with that. Genie A at least. Hey, C is S. Yeah, I agree actually with that one. She got back in the meta now. I don't know why exactly. I guess because of Yeah, I don't know. But she got back in the meta. Uh P is C or D. Maybe D. I think I think D. I think D. Unfortunately, poor Mr. P, man. Po Mr. P. It was broken before though. Yeah, it was broken. And no, it's not anymore. I don't know. It's too many tanks that are rushing it down. Probably C. C again. Nice to have, but you cannot always play him. Byron is B for me at least. Maybe it's a it's a Okay. G is still really strong. Speak for me is A still as well. Yeah, same is A again. I would like low A. The low the lowest one. Rough. Rough is high B for me. I agree. Bus. Yeah, we'll see. Yeah. B again. Low B. It's nice to have sometimes, but it's not always the best. So, an I will put D. Yeah, I agree. No. E all the way down. No, you're getting paid on shooting star sometimes. At least he's getting played unlike other ones. I like rules on board, you know. I mean, we played holy on haste one time on pit stop on pit stop. It's pit stop. Pit stop is pit stop. It's a different matter. I'll put him here. I think he can have some e. Yeah, so so middle me like this. Janet is a s. No, I don't think yes. I don't think before was before anymore. Maybe not now. I live a I love him as a candy counter. Um but I don't think he's anything anything of that. I'll put him like here. Yeah. Oh, it just be bast. That's S. You think? Not a no. I mean you just get countered by two growers. Jackie and H. What do you pick? I mean on that you get rid of that just going to get hypers for free. Sure. Sure. Great. A yeah if you have him on hot song it's basically guaranteed to win and great bustar combo as well as super strong art. One of a really good snip. He's getting a bit less right now, but I think a Mandy or LT, which one is better? I like Mandy more. I prefer LT because of that corner tank. But for me, Mandy is A. Honestly, if we put RT on A, we should put Mandy A, too. All right, there you go. Willow got the hyper charge now. Not that it's going to do anything for it though. Um, it's a really nice thrower if you want to be sure against max comps or like aggressive comps. I think it's C or B. B. Yeah, I like that. Perfect. Um, well, we're not going to talk. I mean, we're not going to talk much about that. I mean, it's only heist and it's only highest. How was it E? E. Yeah. Okay. This just it's like heist. Uh, Charlie really overrated in my opinion from from Asia right now. Played a lot of months final. My last one. Got completely stomped on that final. I think D or C. Yeah, I think C is fine. C is fine. It's an average baller. It's not the best, but I wouldn't like go in first. Miko got a buff. Everyone played him a lot in ranked especially in some scrums as well. Especially his base race in in heist. I don't know about it now. Like I think it just see high. Yeah, I agree. But not it doesn't go to B. No, he's not like a pick always, but it can be nice to play. Melody is like B or A for me. Which one you think? We're not getting that much melody. Lastly, normally we play max melody most of the time. Leave it be for now. Okay. High B. Yeah. Uh Lily hypercharge. Honestly, you get hyper charge really fast. I quite like it. I will go A honestly. Yeah, I'm down for that. Put a low low A though. Okay. Uh Clancy have a charge does not matter anything. The only way you go Clansancy is if you have a free match up. So like average. Yep. I don't see I would say it's B or A. He's getting played more than than T. Yeah, because it counters a lot of Yeah, especially Ki K a lot on a lot of B maps. So I think I'm fine with putting him low of A. Okay. Even though he's not always a best pick, but he's really nice pick. Uh Juju. Okay. A them still getting played quite a lot. Ollie is A or S for me. I will go S. It's just way too broken. Things is A or A. I think it's not broken. It's it's not broken, but it's really it's really so good. It's so safe. Lumis S. Yeah. Uh J is SP getting picked more actually. It's B. I think. Yeah, I think it's high B as well, though. I'm down for that. Crow. Um Crow, it got buffed, but not much. Your choice. Just put it here. Okay. You're not going to see it in bro. You're not going to see it anywhere that is not haste. So Leon is getting played quite a lot in bounty as sniper counter. I will put a bit low. Okay. Uh Sandy is I don't see he fell out of the meta somehow. Yeah, they just run it down. Let's see. Let's see. Okay. Um Amber with no the hypercharge is really broken. It's so broken. It's basically better hyper. So I put it low again. Yeah, I'm fine with that. It's it's getting played more and more right now. So let's see how that develops. But yeah, me we're playing a lot of me just because you're playing me bar a lot. Yeah. So I think B is like fine. Uh search is B. C. Yeah. You fine with low lows of B? I'm fine, too. No, whatever. We have too much on B. Let's go see. Uh Chester is uh Cordelius above average. Yeah, sure. This is a lot of like pre stuff, but nothing else. Yeah, just like hard tanks, I guess. Kit is an interesting one. I will go for A. If you know how to use Kit, it's so annoying in every single map. It's so hard to use. So, like you do one mistake, you use those. But yeah. Yeah, but it's um Draco is the hot zone king. A Okay. Ki is broken and we will just assume that Kaza will be broken as well. Yeah, like the order for me will be Lumi before Kenji, Kenji, Jay Young. These are like the top three. I will put Kenji J and Kumi. You think Lumi last? Yeah. From top three. So we compromise and we put in the middle. Okay. I just think Kenji is first. Anything that we should still should change at the end. I think S is like pretty fit the meta. Yeah. Yeah. The bow I think the needs to be. I think between that bonus at the high ins is not that good. Looks nice. Looks nice. Car looks nice. Juju looks nice. Can't be a bit higher. Honestly, Griffith for hyper might be A. What do you think? No, you like you're so slow to get the pictures and it's just not that good. Like it's good. They only get like two kills. Takes too long to get it. Okay. Ctier don't see much that I prefer there. It just counters of two brawlers or three Bers and that's it. Dtier as well. I wouldn't could put the M higher if you want just for vocal counter but yeah that's fantastic. Uh well that's not tier list. We have basically the top rollers uh the ST brawlers which you really like first pick on most of the maps here. Kaz, which when she comes out, Kenji, Lumi, Jay Young, the top three brawlers, and then in no order B, Barry, Chester, Hank, Buster, Angelum, Ollie just played around all the maps currently. Really, really annoying. Um at the bottom here, you have used Brawers, which you should avoid. Um which is just stuck. You should never pick them honestly. Just never don't go them. Uh and then you have like good better brawlers, which you can always go like two, three on most of the maps. Most notably, you can see a lot of snipers here. That's mostly because they can play the snipers only like bounty knockout, but then also like gem grip open maps that will always be fine. Um, and hot zone open maps like open zone for example, really open map. Snipers thrive there as well, especially Lola pretty good there as well. There's some meta brawlers. Then BTR are some solid choices that you can go most of the time. Um, not the main choice. Griff, for example, is mostly against tanks. You would not like to pick Griff into like a control comp because you will never get your hypercharge, but if you get your hypercharge, you will get insane value. Uh, and that's basically mostly this category that goes like if you have a insane matchup that dollar is going to be insane. Ct is like, yeah, can work. Not our first choice. Can work, works, I guess. Don't shouldn't usually pick him. Um, DT is like, yeah, it's my last choice to go if it works. Uh, E tier is just, yeah, don't pick him. It's useless. It's not the worst. Like, it's playable, but always going to be like bad pick. That's how it is for Humble for the meta of the new hypercharges that come out with Lily Batch. I hope you enjoyed it. I hope this will help you in your future rank push. I hope they change rank does well with that. Thank you everyone for watching. I really appreciate it. And see you guys on the next video. Bye-bye."

    "title": "*TIER LIST* DEL META DE BRAWL STARS DE MAYO",
    "creator": "Rol - Brawl Stars Competitivo",
    "transcript": "Si te gusta saber meta de Brawl Stars, tranquilo, porque voy a traerte la mejor tierlist de todo YouTube. ¿Y por qué es la mejor tierlist que vas a encontrar en todo YouTube? Pues bueno, para el que no me conozca, hola, yo soy Roll, soy entrenador profesional de Brawl Stars para Timer Etics y estoy entrenando y preparándome muchísimo los partidos que se están viniendo estos días. Ya sabéis que estos viendo a ver si se hace algún cambio, si no, bueno, está todo un poquito en el aire, pero llevamos entrenando muchísimo. Y para el que no me conozca de mi pasado, yo soy entrenador profesional de Brawl Stars. Vamos, desde que empezó el competitivo, llevo siendo profesional cuatro últimos años y he clasificado a los últimos cuatro mundiales, pero esto no empieza ahí. Llevo jugando desde hace mucho más y siendo entrenador mucho más en equipos más pequeños como Artic Gaming, Team Queso. Y bueno, también he pasado por equipos como Tribe Gaming, AC Milan Class, eh Food Esports y ahora estamos en Teamis. Así que bueno, sin hacernos más espera, vamos a ir con la tierlist. Empezamos con los brawlers especiales, super especiales, épicos, míticos, legendarios y así avanzando hasta el final. Y dado si queréis encontrar algún problema exacto, solamente tenéis que saber su rareza e ir directamente a esa parte del vídeo. Así que empezamos. Vale, chicos, si queréis una aproximación de cómo va a ser esto, digamos que en ese van a estar los brawlers más rotos, los que están más fuertes del meta y que probablemente tenáis que mejorar en A. los siguientes que también está muy fuerte, pero no están tan rotos como para ser FPC siempre, ya me entendéis, ¿no? Como que está muy muy bien el meta, pero tampoco tanto. En B y en C estarán los brawlers que están normal en el meta, ni arriba ni abajo. Se pueden jugar depende de la situación y puede ser que tengan unos problemers mejores que ellos mismos en ese o en A. Y en D y E los brablers que no debería jugar y en E, los que son injugables prácticamente o que no se ven apenas en situaciones. Así que bueno, vamos a empezar. Ya sabéis que voy a dedicar una dos frases a cada brawler más o menos para que tengáis una idea aproximada de cómo está en el meta. Vale, empezamos con Sell primer brawler, brawler que todo el mundo tiene nada más desbloquear el juego y por desgracia se va a ir a tier F. Hay muchos, es un antitanque que debería parar tanques y sin embarco estamos dando cuenta en el meta que hay muchos tanques que pueden ganar la es una locura pero es real, así que el que se va a ir a tier F, no hace suición de antitanque a la perfección hay mejores problemas, así que se va a quedar ahí. Nita, buen antitanque. Esto sí es un buen ejemplo antitanque, no de los mejores del meta, pero sí que está bastante bien en ciertos mapas, así que yo la voy a poner directamente en cierpe sin ningún miedo. Me parece que está siendo bastante buena en ciertas situaciones. La hace counter no solo a brawlers eh tanques, sino también le hace counters a otros brawlers como Tara. Eh, cuando pone el oso hay muchos brawlers que lo pasan muy muy mal. Así que esta Nita que sair a TRB Colt no se está viendo mucho, pero sí que hay muchos papás de he de lo mejor que puedes piquear, así que lo voy a poner en tier C. No es muy muy bueno, pero tampoco es muy muy malo. Lo dejamos en tierce que ahí está perfectamente Bull, uno de los peores tanques del juego. Probablemente no tiene lo que viene siendo una manera de aguantar vivo, así que lo vamos a dejar en tierte. Lo dejamos ahí y que no salga. Vale, chicos, pasamos a tier, eh, perdón, pasamos a Brock, que se va a meter con Colt. Se ve en alguna situación o bueno, puede que no, eh. Creo que Brock lo voy a mandar incluso a Tierde con Bull. Le falta algo, ¿no creéis que no se está viendo apenas nada? Le hace counter muchísimo brawlers, eh, snipers también los tanques, velocidades como max. Lo vamos a dejar en tier D, no lo estoy viendo absolutamente nada. El primo tier C brawler bastante decente para hacer counter a otro tanques, perdón, pero no está entre lo más jugado. Barley. Barley quizás sea el primer brawler que va a mover a tier A. Eh, me parece un brawler con hipercarga muy muy bueno. Se ve muchos mapas y puede hacerle counter a muchísimos brawlers. También hace counter algunos throwers como puede ser Berry para fidearse muchísimo y cargar muchísimas ultiscargas. La voy a dejar ahí en tier a poco otro brother que se va tier A. Se ve bastante, te cambia el meta, ¿eh? Bueno, quizás está entre tiera y tier B, quizás no llega tanto a tiera. Lo vamos a dejar en tier B. Creo que es un que no se ve tanto como para ponerlo en tiera, pero sí que es muy bueno en muchos mapas, así que de momento lo dejamos ahí. Rosa brawler bastante malillo. Creo que lo voy a dejar en tier D. Creo que no lo voy a subir a C de momento. Se puede ver, sí se puede ver. Para mí no es el mejor player del mundo y creo que le ayuda mucho es el poder poner tantos arbustos, pero hay tantos antidankers y tiene una manera tan difícil de acercarse al rival es que por lo menos el pivo puede saltar. Bull incluso puede ir en línea recta, pero es que Rosa no tiene nada para acercarse, así que de momento le voy a poner en tierde. Pasamos con Jessie que se está viendo algo, pero tampoco mucho le voy a poner en tierc. Se va a ver. Sí, pero tampoco una locura. Le percarga todavía no sigue, no termina de destacar. De momento lo vamos a dejar en tierce. Dynamike a tierce también se puede ver, sí, pero no es el mejor thrower ni de coña. Se queda un poquito atrás, así que de momento lo ponemos ahí. Tic, lo vamos a subir a tier B. Es un brawler asequible, se puede jugar, no está tan mal, pero situaciones muy exactas y sobre todo en bounty y en y enqueo se ve bastante, por eso lo voy a subir un poquito más. 8 bit lo vamos a dejar en tier C o tier B, no va a ser C, en plan, se puede ver en situaciones muy exactas, pero solo lo estamos viendo en gemas, ya ni siquiera lo estamos viendo en mapas de he, así que se va a quedar ahí rico tier B antitanque bastante bueno siempre y cuando tengas el mapa y el momento donde jugarlo, también la habilidad personaje con bastante habilidad y que no todo el mundo puede jugarlo, eh, se puede complicar un poco. Darril, un buen tanque. Ahora sí que sí lo vamos a dejar en tier B. Se puede ver, está bastante bien, pero es cierto que hay mucha gente que no lo termina de jugar, así que de momento tier B no lo vas a subir mucho más. Penny, uf, Penny, tengo mis dudas, eh, lo había estado pensando antes, no sé si apuntado algo. Creo que le voy a dejar en tierce, no termina de estar tan bien. Le han bajado bastante m el mortero, tal, no sé, no lo termino de ver. De momento lo vamos a dejar en tier C, pero lo podrías subir un poquito a tier B. Carl, indiscutible. Tier A, muy muy buen brawler. a pesar de los nerfeos que está recibiendo, sigue siendo lo mejor que puede jugar en el meta. Jacki, ojo porque Jacki sube bastante, no solo por Jacki Casket, sino también por el buff a ciertos brawlers que la deja eh muy alta. Por ejemplo, es un brawler que hace counter a brawlers meta como Kenji, como Sade, por lo tanto ha subido bastante, estaría entre A y B, eh, tendría que pensármelo bastante. También le hace Counter Bter, es que es un brawler muy meta, chicos. Creo que lo voy a poner en A. Eh, estaba dudando si ponerla en B o en A, pero al ver que es un brawler que está baneando todo el mundo, porque si quieres piquear Baster, Sate o Kenji, es un brawler que tienes que banear sí o sí, entonces lo voy a dejar entiera mucho ojo. Está Yai que viene fuerte, pero es verdad que también se puede bajar a eh un poquito ya cada uno decisión de cada uno. Yo de momento lo voy a poner aquí Gus y y tiera o tier, ¿qué decís vosotros? Yo lo voy a poner en tier B. La hipercarga me pensaba que iba a ser mucho mejor, pero la verdad es que no hace nada, no cambia la partida como otras hipercargas. Lo dejo en TierP, sigue estando decente en ciertos mapas, pero no es lo mejor que vais a encontrar. Bo, Bo, que se va directo al tier A. Brawler con rango, brawler con daño, me gusta bastante. De momento lo vamos a dejar aquí muy muy top. Eh, MZ eh pensando eh pensando pensamientos, la voy a dejar en tier D o C. Es que no le estoy viendo nada. No lo he visto ni una vez en competitivo desde que empezó el año. Le falta algo, no sé qué es, pero algo le falta. Lo voy a dejar en cierte. Bueno, sí se ha visto en Latinoamérica, pero en Europa yo personalmente ningún entreno ni nada, así que lo voy a dejar ahí. ST puede ser que siga en tier A, puede ser que lo podamos bajar incluso a tier B. Yo de momento lo dejo en Tier A. Eh, sigue estando bastante okay y se es un brawler muy muy completo. Eh, Piper que se va a ir a tier. Sí, Tiera o Tier Tier A, ¿no? ¿Qué tipo otro? Yo es que no sé si tiera o tier B está quizás no es de lo mejor. Vamos a decir que en tier S están los mejores br del meta, ¿no? Lo que es indiscutiblemente bueno y en tiera que se pueden jugar en casi todos los mapas. Mirad como esto lo podemos jugar en casi todo, pero es verdad que Piper no se puede jugar en todos los mapas, solamente en bounty tal, noqueo, alguno de he vas a dejar en B. Está muy bien el meta, pero no está entre lo mejor. Pam, que ha subido bastante. Le voy a dejar en tier A. La estoy viendo muy muy fuerte. La estoy viendo de lo mejor que hay. Y quizás sí que la ponga en el tier A. Sí, lo vamos a dejar ahí porque se está moviendo bastante. Frank, lo vamos a poner en tier C. No es de lo mejor, pero sí es verdad que se va a tirar ciertos tanques meta también. Entonces, bueno, tías de justicia. Vivi, Bibi, no la termino de ver, la vamos a dejar en tier D. No termina de encajar. Yo de momento le voy a poner aquí, incluso voy a hacer una modificación, chicos, y voy a mover a Bull a TRF, chicos. Creo que va a haber muy poco probable en TRF. Al final creo que BR está haciendo un buen intento en subir los probes bajos y cada vez están más igualados. De momento lo vamos a dejar en tier Full y está vive en tier D. Bea podría estar perfectamente en tier S, me parece a mí, ¿eh? Pero la vamos a bajar a tiera. Creo que se puede ver en tier S. Es un brawler muy completo, muchas veces en FPCK indiscutible y baneo. Entonces, lo vamos a dejar este tier A, pero podría ser perfectamente un tier eh eh de los mejores antitanques que podemos ver debido a la cantidad de mapas abiertos que hay. Nani no termina de estar bien. Se ve muy poco. Vamos a dejar el tier Clemente para hacer counter a ciertos brawlers. No me encaja, no me encaja, oye. No, no deía que encajarme. Edgar, pues Edgar no está mal, ¿eh? Estaría entre B y C. Lo voy a dejar en C, pero ojo, porque se puede llegar a ver más, ¿eh? Hubo un tiempo en que Edgar estaba tiers, chicos, o Tier Globus y la gente no se lo creía, pero sí, Edgar que sale del pozo, se queda en tier C. Griff, muy bien y cada vez mejor debido a esta hipercarga que le van a poner. Creo que lo voy a poner incluso en tier B. Lo veo un poquito mejor que los jugador que los probable de tier C. Está ahí, ahí lo vamos a dejar aquí. Creo que se puede ver bastantes mapas y cuando le meta el piccar que va a subir un montón. Grom lo vamos a dejar en tier C. No es el mejor thrower, pero si tienes habilidad con él puede cambiar la partida. Está claro. Bonnie, Bonnie se está viendo bastante ahora. El bufado, lo voy a dejar en tier B. Ahora se ve en Hair, se puede ver en bounty, incluso en noqueo en algún mapilla. Lo veo bastante asequible. La vamos a dejar en tier B. Los eh main bonnie que pueden sonreír porque la verdad que está bastante fuerte. Gale se va a ir a tier B, quizás sea el mejor full antitanque. Si tiene delante muchos antitanques, lo podría bajar a C, pero bueno, yo lo voy a dejar en tier B. Colet bastante regulera, no se está viendo que si nada, hay bastante counter, lo voy a dejar de momento en tier C, pero podríamos ponerlo en tier B perfect y en tier D incluso. Puede que también. Bell muy completo. Lo vamos a dejar en tier A. Lo veo muy muy top y cada vez se ve de más as podría estar en A, pero lo voy a dejar en B. Creo que hay muchos antitanques en este met, pero ojo porque podríamos subirlo perfectamente a tierra. Yo de momento lo voy a dejar en tier B. Lola, Lola no está mal. Podríamos dejarlo en tier C. Empezamos a abrir ya el doble reglón en tier C. No la termino de ver. Le falta algo, no sé, como que algo todavía me falta para esta Lola. Sam, muy mal. La gent F. Pensábamos que leer carga iba a cambiar el meta, no lo hizo y de hecho se quedó bastante estancado. Lo vamos a dejar a Sama ahí en ese tier F. Mandy, Mandy no está nada mal, ¿eh? Creo que le voy a poner en tier C o D. Creo que le voy a poner en B. En C, perdón. No se está viendo tanto. No está mal. La hipercarga de hecho Bounty es de lo mejor que puedes tener y si eres buenam mandandy, puedes carrilear la partida entera, pero yo le voy a ver en tier C. Recordemos que tier B y tier C son como los brawlers más igualados, los que están bien de meta y no tienen que estar ni muy arriba ni muy abajo. Así que es un brawler que lo veo bien, no creo que haya que nerfearla ni bufarla. Está bien ahí. Quita un pequeño buff, pero muy muy pequeño. Me cada vez me gusta más. Incluso lo voy a poner en tier B. Creo que es un antitanque muy completo, de los pocos antitanques que puede parar a como Jacki, así que se va a quedar ahí. Hank, Hank de mi vida. Perdonad, perdonad por esto que voy a hacer, pero lo voy a poner en tieres. Me parece de los mejores probes que hay ahora mismo, eh, muy completo, difícil de conterear, eh, se ven todos los mapas. Hank es nuestro primer tier S porque está bastante completo. Pe que se va a ir a tier C. Ni fu ni fa se puede ver en algunos mapas, pero tampoco es lo mejor. Larry, Lauri, tier B me parecen completos, no son los mejores throwers, pero lo vamos a dejar en tier B. Y ojo porque empezamos a meternos en los braules ya más interesantes. Angelo, segundo brawler en su vida TS muy muy bueno, el mejor sniper posible hace counter incluso a Throwes porque puede atravesar y de un disparo con ulti puede cargarse a muchos. Así que este Angel se queda en tier S. Berry, muy buen brawler, lo vamos a dejar en tier A, se está viendo cada vez más y, incluso se podría bajar a tier B, pero creo que está bastante bien ahí, me gusta mucho y creo que da para hacer muchísimas estrategias, así que lo vamos a dejar en tier A. Sade, entre tier A y tier B. Hm, creo que le dejar en Tierb simplemente porque hay momentos en los que es muy difícil que este rol se meta en ciertos mapas por la cantidad de mapas abiertos que hay. Así que lo vamos a dejar en Tier B, pero está muy muy bien. Si sabéis jugarlo está genial. MEL estaría entre tier S y tier A. Lo voy a dejar en tier A. Creo que no llega a ser tan tiers. No llega a ser para tanto, pero lo vamos a poner ahí. Mortis lo estoy viendo cada vez mejor, ¿eh? Lo vamos a dejar en tier B. No llega a ser de A, pero casi. Eh, lo veo muy muy top. Creo que puede dar la vuelta a muchas partidas y un buen Mortis ahora mismo puede carrilear el meta. Tara que le vamos a poner en tiera. Me parece muy buen brawler, muy buen antitanques ahora que hay muchos tanques y, incluso en gemas la veo un pck casi obligatorio, incluso casi de fest pick la veo muy top, me está gustando mucho esta tarara, cada vez más es lo que estoy viendo en trenos y es un predict mío. Realmente estaría por ti en BC, pero os digo que provéis tratar en gemas porque creo que simplemente cargarle percarga y en último segundo ir a la base del rival y robarle las gemas es una locura. Así que le vamos a poner este tier A, genio también en tieras. Bueno, tier A o tier B, lo voy a poner en tier A porque creo que en mapas como Bounty, como Gema, Bounty y Noko, es lo mejor que has visto este genio en tu vida. Pero además se puede jugar en gemas, en algunos mapas abiertos de Brawl Ball se puede llegar a ver, lo vas a dejar ahí, Max, tier o tier A, eh, creo que lo voy a dejar en tier A. Está ahí, ahí lo vamos a dejar ahí porque creo que no termina de ser pues fesp en todos los mapas, ¿no? Pero podría ser de los muy altos de Topa, casi entrando en tier S. Mr. P no lo termino de ver, lo vamos a dejar en tier C. Se puede ver en algún momento, pero tampoco no. No sé la demás gente cómo lo pondrá, pero yo lo voy a poner en tierce. No, no lo termino de ver. Sprout tierce también no llega a ser el mejor thrower. Lo veo un poquito fuerita del meta. Byron. Byron está bastante bien. Lo voy a poner en tiera. A o B. A o B. Lo voy a poner en tier B. Creo que est poniendo problem en tiera. Es un problema es muy muy bueno. Podría estar en tiera perfectamente, pero para mí que le falta un poquito más todavía. Squck tier B perfectamente y bien verecido. Muy muy bueno. Low antitanque, por lo tanto se va casi directo al tier. Muy muy bien. Se está viendo bastante poco le hace bastante counter, pero este low creo que está bastante bastante bien. Es que no sé si o B, eh, quizás lo voy a mover a B. Creo que a tiene que ser solamente los que se ve en todos los mapas. Se ve en todos los mapas. Bueno, en casi todos sí, eh. Eh, cuestión de gustos, lo podéis mover a A, lo podéis mover a B, como vosotros queráis. Roofs, lo voy a poner en tier C. Se ve en ciertos mapas, pero muy muy indicados. Buff, tier B se está viendo bastante para conterar. Ciertos brawlers. Fang, lo siento, chicos, sé que no sé que os gusta mucho y sé que pensáis que está rotísimo, pero la verdad es que no. La verdad es que se quedó un poquito inútil. Lo voy a dejar en tier D. Ibi, muy buen Brawler. Lo voy a mover a tier B. No creo que llegue a estar en tier, pero ahí Janet lo vas a mover a tier. Eh, sigue siendo bastante buena, ¿eh? Bueno, incluso la podíamos bajar a tier B, ¿no? Ahí, ahí. Lo voy a dejar en tier A porque creo que puede estar bastante roto y puede ser de los mejores en ciertos mapas, pero ahí OT se lo vas a mover a tier B. Se puede ver algo, pero tampoco se está viendo mucho. Baster, tiera, indiscutible, muy brawler, probablemente de los mejores tanques del juego. Grey también. Tiera muy muy top. Eh, se está viendo mucho mapa de gemas, mucho mapa de noqueo. Casi que se podría subir a ese, pero lo voy a dejar en A porque ahí hay ahí. Eh, RT tier B perfectamente de los mejores brawlers que hay así de larga distancia. Además, antitan, ya lo veo muy muy bien. Willow se va a ir a tier Casi D. Eh, lo voy a poner en tier D, incluso creo que se puede jugar en Cones muy muy exactas de Brawl Ball, pero ya está, no se ve en nada más. D está mal, creo que cada vez se va a ver más. Lo voy a poner en tier D, pero casi que lo pongo en C. Lo voy a poner en tier D porque aún tenemos que probarlo y muchos equipos no se atreven a jugarlo. De momento se va a quedar en este tier D. Chuck. Me parece un brawler indiscutible para un mapa de Hase. Es de lo mejor que te puedes encontrar en Heista lo voy a poner en C porque solo se puede ver en He, pero digo de verdad que en he mejor brawler que puedes ver. De verdad, a lo mejor le estoy haciendo mala justicia y habrá que subirlo a B. La verdad que un buffa chak no lo queremos. Vamos a dejarlo en en Ah, no en tierce enerce en tierce. Está bien, no queremos un buff a este brawler y está bastante asequible. Charlie en cierto momento está bien. Le voy a poner en tier C. Miko ha subido bastante en el metal. La vamos a poner en tier B, chicos. Mico hace una cantidad de daño a caja muy grande. Eh, también se puede ver como asesino, mapas de bounty, noqueo, eh, se ve bastante. Lo vamos a poner en este tier B porque está bastante bastante bien. Melody se ve algo. Lo voy a hacer en Tier B. Tampoco es de lo mejor mejor, pero bueno, pues ahí está. Se está viendo bastante, ¿eh? Lili, sí, la voy a subir a ver. La hipercarga le da un pequeño buff tampoco muy grande. Quizá debería que ponerla en tier C. Voy a ponerla de momento en tier C. Bueno, vamos a ver qué tal funciona y ya veremos qué tal. Clan no lo termino de ver. Estaría en tier C o en tier D. Lo voy a poner en tier D. Creo que no es el mejor antitanque ni mucho menos, así que lo vamos a dejar por ahí en medio. Mou que se va a tier B perfectamente. La verdad que sigue estando muy bien. Yu es S o a eh o A. Eh, vamos a dejarlo en A. En A. La verdad que no termina ser de los mejores. Oli sigue siendo un tier. A sigue estando muy muy top. Finx también se va a tier. Muy bueno Lumi. Siguiente BR que entra en Tiers y de los últimos ya muy muy bien esta Lumi se está viendo bastante y sigue siendo a pesar del nerf bastante bastante buena. Y ojo porque a lo mejor me va a faltar espacio por aquí, ¿eh? Veo que está la que tiene un poquito ajustada. Spike lo vamos a dejar en tierce. No es el mejor antitanque tampoco está muy allá. Bueno, sin más. Crow, que también se va a tier C. León también se va a ir al Tier C, así que vamos a hacer un pequeño parón para reajustar la tabla. Vale, chicos, seguimos. León que se va a ir a Tier C. Se puede ver algo, pero tampoco es de lo mejor. Se queda ahí de momento. No lo termino de ver entre los mejores brawlers, la verdad. Sandy entre C y B también. Lo voy a dejar en tier C. Está bastante bien, pero sé más. Amber sube a Tiera, me parece de los mejores brawlers que podemos ver ahora mismo. Lo vamos a dejar en Tiera y creo que se va a ver bastante. Meg, bueno, está bien. Nifuá entre C y D creo que la voy a dejar en C. Creo que no termina de estar tan tan fuerte como muchos pensamos. Surch también se va al tier C. A veces se ataca mucho a la partida y no puede avanzar y se sufre bastante. Chester que se va a ir a tier ese de los mejores brawlers del meta. Muy muy top este Chester. Está bastante bastante bien. Cordilius. Cordilius que se va a ir a tier C. Se ven situaciones exactas. No termina de estar con los del A. Lo con los del B dejar en tier C. Kit que se va a tier A, sigue siendo lo mejor, sigue estando muy muy bien. Draco que lo vamos a dejar en tier B, no está entre los mejores, pero bastante seguible. Kenji que se va a tier S y Ja que se va a tir Kenji en Tier S. Simplemente por lo bien que está eh superc. La verdad que da, voy a hacer un poquito la tierlist así para que la veáis mejor. La verdad que es un brawler muy muy potente. Tiene una hipercarga que la cambia entera todo, cambia todo el juego entero. De repente todos los bos para Kenji está muy muy bien. ¿Y por qué Jaon arriba si no tiene daño rolls y tal? Lo que he visto competitivo, lo que os puedo decir es que va a ser casi siempre fespiqueado o baneado. Es lo que estoy viendo. Creo que es muy completo. Es como un Maxi un poco en el mismo equipo. Me parece una locura. Y el counter principal es crow, yo diría, por el anti el slow, el anticura, la verdad que le haría bastante counter, pero yo no me quería poner en ese. Es una predicción y ya veremos a ver qué tal me sale. Faltaría un poquito el brawler nuevo KCE, que todavía no ha salido cuando estoy grabando este vídeo, así que no sabían cómo ponerlo. Supongo que saldrá en ese porque si es un brawler ultra legendario, pues algo lo será. Así que bueno chicos, hagamos un pequeño resumen. Tier los mejores pelos del meta, los que la gente vanía para ellos están superb y siempre que estén deberíis piquearlos y deberíais subirlos si podéis. Ahí lo estáis viendo. Tier A, personajes que están muy bien en el meta, pero que no es de lo mejor, pero se ven en casi todos los mapas. Tier B, brawlers que están bien en el meta y en la situación exacta te puede cambiar la partida, así que están muy bien. Tier C, personajes que están ahí ahí en el meta, no están muy mal y la situación perfecta se pueden jugar, pero tampoco te van a cambiar mucho la partida. tier de personajes, no recomiendo jugar, pero que en momentos exactos, pues oye, puede que no vayan mal, pero no llegan a estar ahí y TRF no los piquéis porque hay mejores que ellos seguro, seguro, seguro. Así que nada más, chicos, este ha sido el vídeo. Si os ha servido, suscribiros al canal porque de verdad que se aprecia un montón las suscripciones. Y nada más, chicos. Espero que os haya ayudado este vídeo."

    "transcript": "Uh well, let's not list this. We have basically the top rollers, uh the ST brawlers, which you really should like first pick on most of the maps here. Just played around all the maps currently. Really, really annoying. Um at the bottom here, you have the use, which you should avoid. Um which is just stuck. You should never take them honestly. Just never don't go. Uh and then you have like the better brawlers, which you can always go like for free on most of the maps. Most notably, you can see a lot of snipers here. That's both good because they can play the snipers only like bounty knockout, but then also in like jungle buff maps, they will always be fine. There's some meta ballers, then BTR are some solid choices that you can go most of the time. Um, not the main choice. Uh, and that's basically mostly this category that goes like if you have a same matchup that is going to be insane. CT is like, yeah, can work. Not our first choice. Can works, I guess. Don't shouldn't usually pick them. Um, DT is like, yeah, it's my last choice to go if it works. Uh, Etier is just, yeah, don't pick them. It's useless. That's for Humble."
