    "transcript": "Today, I'll show you the top five best decks to play if you want to reach ultimate champion. Starting things off with the fifth best deck to use if you want to get ultimate champion, we have Royal Giant with the tombstone skelly king and the new evolved witch. We're actually facing giant right now, which is going to be a perfect opportunity to showcase this deck. And guys, even if you don't have the evolved witch, you can always just play Evo Archers instead, and the deck will basically work just as good. Okay, so that's a perfect amount of lightning value right there. Beautiful stuff. I think we should be okay because the zappies really just carry the defense of this deck against beatd down. It's a really really good deck if you struggle to beat stuff like giant golem pekka things like that. He kind of messed up his zap timing right there. I could actually try to go in aggressive with my RG right here. So I think I I think I will just play it at the bridge. He wasted the prince. He wasted the e drag. He spent quite a few elixir. So this should be pretty good for us. This deck is just really good if you're a player who wants a good defense but also a relatively nice offense at the same time. It's kind of just like I I would say the best of both worlds. And guys, even as even as we get higher up in the deck rankings here, just keep in mind that certain decks are going to be better for certain players based on what you want out of a deck. Wait, no way that heal spirit is still connected right there. I could fisherman, but I feel like I should just let this go. Should I fisherman? I feel like I should have fisherman. How's that getting so much damage? Okay, I should have fisherman. What am I doing? I'm going to set up with the tombstone in the lane right here just because it's going to feed us a bunch of skeletons into our skelly king ability if we play our skelly king. And also the tombstone works super well with the evo witch because it just gives it a constant line of healing basically. So yeah, really nice synergy up in this deck. You can beat pretty much anything with this. You can beat cycle decks pretty nicely, but you can also have a great chance against beatdown as well. I mean it it really is especially good against beatd down. Oh, I just popped my ability, but the evo eagra is going to clear my entire thing. Okay, wait, that didn't work out too bad cuz we kill everything. I kind of wasted my elixir, but we still killed everything. And he's going to have to respond to that as well with his guards, which is probably not really what he wanted to do right there. All right, let's set up with the Evo Witch in the back right now. He's going to have to do something about this. I don't know what he has for this, actually. Okay, we can just go in for the aggressive RG into this. I feel like he probably can't defend this. I think he might lose his tower. I'm not 100% sure, but we're at least going to take most of his tower, and we just have to focus on defending right now. But guys, we do have our lightning, so I think we'll be okay. Yeah, we just go for the lightning on everything right here. This is why you love to have lightning in this deck. This man just stands no chance right now. After that one boss bandit connection he got, he just cannot do anything. Hey, bro. This guy cannot touch us right now. Oh, and by the way, guys, happy Mother's Day. It is Mother's Day at the time of me recording this. So, if there's any mothers watching, happy Mother's Day. I don't even know if that many women play Clash Royale. I think some definitely do, but not like a crazy amount. If you if there are any women watching, definitely give some of the amazing guys in the comment section a chance. Now, moving on to deck number four, guys. We have Royal Hogs Earthquake. This might come as a surprise to some of you because I'm sure there is quite a bit of Mega Knight around the ultimate champion range, but I feel like recently there's been a little bit less and you can actually beat me quite often with this type of deck, with this Royal Hogs deck if you play smartly. What you have to basically do is have insane defense and always play a Royal Hogs split unless your opponent does not have their mega knight in cycle. Ooh, that's a nice delivery right there. Right on the uh hunter and the monk as well. We could just go for our queen right here. It's going to target the hunter first. Unfortunately, monk is kind of a good counter to our deck, but looks like we defended that pretty nicely. And the monk didn't even get a push onto my archer queen. Really bad skeletons by this guy. We could just go for our ability here. And he's going to have to do something. And we could just go for the piggies because he spent so much elixir. Yeah, this guy's low on elixir for sure. He does go for a late fireball, but that was pretty much all the elixir he had left. So, we do get a couple nibbles on the tower, which is actually pretty nice, I would say. I'm just going to cycle my earthquake right on this guy's tower. It's kind of a better play than to waste a delivery on nothing. Okay, he does go in for the RG. This is where it gets pretty difficult because he's probably going to try to get a monk in front of this. And as you guys know, monk does deflect the archer queen and the cannon. So, we're going to have to play this pretty smartly. What you mainly want to do is get to your Evo Ice Spirit as fast as possible in this matchup. I'm also going to go ahead and piggies because what that's going to make him do is it's going to make the monk most likely stay behind the RG. Monk, what are you doing? Okay, we can pop our queen ability. You can actually pop your queen ability even when the monk is just barely still deflecting because the archer queen takes a second to get into its ability and wrap its cloak over itself. So, that was a very good defense right there even without our EVO ice spirit yet in cycle. And right now, I guess we could just go in for some piggies here because he pretty much always has to fireball them, which means that we just get free damage pretty much because piggy still gets some damage through it. We do get a lot of piggies damage here. He actually decided to go for a hunter instead. And if he goes for a monk at the bridge, I think we'll be fine. Yes, he goes for the bridge monk. I'm going to kind of pull the monk to the side. The reason why I do this against monk decks is because it makes it so the cannon is not in range of the monk and it's just going to allow our cannon to actually DPS down the RG instead of getting distracted on the wrong things. I could go for a log and everything right here, but since we're already up in damage, I'm not really too worried about taking just a couple measly RG shots to our tower. This guy's going to have to stop the piggies and the archer queen here, too. So, he's definitely in a bit of a pickle. No ability. That feels so bad. I'm so sorry for letting you down, archer queen. I'm so sorry. Okay, look at this guys, though. The monk is going behind the RG once again. This is exactly why I keep going for the piggies like this. It's because it just brings the monk backwards and it makes it so their RG doesn't have the proper support. I know he has another RG in cycle, though. So, that's why I'm playing my queen kind of up high into this monk right here. We're going to have to try to go for a queen ability. No, actually, the queen's done for at this point. Oh, no. Wait, wait. Okay, I I just had the cell of the century, but then this guy also had the cell of the century. Oh my gosh, guys. I did not mean to piggies right there. I meant to cannon, but then this guy just did the fireball on absolutely nothing. I don't know. I don't know why that guy fireball nothing. Wait, we actually get like no damage right there. Okay, wait. He might try to monk at the bridge. We have to be really really careful. Wait, is that in front? Wait, that's in front, huh? Yeah, that's in front. Beautiful. Oh my gosh, this is bad. Nice. We're able to pull the monk kind of far, though, so I think our cannon will do some pretty nice work. No way. It's getting reflected. No way. Wait, he missed the fireball again. Wait, pull this. Wait, guys. No, we got it. We got it. All we have to do is get to one more earthquake. Okay, we just earthquake here and I think we get him before he has enough time to win. Yeah, man. Amazing win right there. That was very close, but I'll take it. Now, for deck number three, we have this brand new meta electro giant deck. I'm just going to go for my aggressive egiant first play. This is normally not the best play, but I know this guy is playing mortar. So, yeah, we kind of just know each other's decks at Tall Bladder a lot of the time, but normally you want to play a little bit more passively, of course. But this deck does really, really good at countering beatdown decks, especially like Mega Knight decks, um, you know, giant graveyard decks, just really the annoying decks of the meta usually do get countered pretty nicely by Electro Giants. So, it's a pretty good deck to run for a lot of people. I'm going to go ahead and play my Lightning right here. Kind of a late Lightning. Probably could have got that a little bit earlier, but overall, we got some damage on the left side, so we're not in too bad of a spot right now. May have to go for a bomber if he tries to pop the ability, but I think we're fine. Oh, he really does go for a last second ability. Hopefully, it doesn't work. Wait, how is that getting so much damage? How? Yo, that cost so much damage. But I think we're fine, though. And guys, you might also notice that we do have the uh brand new Goblin Hut in this deck, which is pretty interesting. It does work pretty well in case of in place of the Goblin Cage. The Goblin Cage is really good as well, but the Goblin Hut gives you more air defense, and also it gives you a bit more of a consistent counter push, I feel like, because obviously the cage brawler has a lot of HP and all, but when you have a Goblin Hut, you can kind of get multiple counter pushes instead of just like a one-time counter push. Ooh, beautiful bowler lineup there, man. Look at that. If he had princess tower, probably be good game already. But unfortunately, canineer is kind of a hard counter to electrogant. But yet, we're still beating this guy right now. We do have to be careful though because I know his next mortar is going to be evolved. But luckily, we have bowler and stuff like that. I guess I'll just get my baby dragon going in the back. I'm kind of holding off on playing my electro giant for a second right now just to make sure that we have our cycle all good and stuff like that. Nice lightning right there on the witch. He does go for the immort. We could just go for our bowler onto it. We do get that beautiful lineup right on the Evo mortar despite the skelly king attempt to kind of uh block off my bowler. Also got a bit of damage again there on the uh left side. He can't really ability here. Yeah, we could just go for the E giant. He actually is giving up. He accidentally hit my E giant. Okay, anyways, I'll see you guys in the next match. The number two best deck to get to ultimate champion with has to be this really aggressive bridge spam deck that just recently started appearing in the meta and it's really just been taking over top ladder especially. But I think it's a great deck to get to ultimate champion with. You have so much aggressive pressure and you have really really good defense with the Evo Snowball as well as the evolved executioner. Feel like the evolved executioner is really really good right now and you don't even really need the tornado with it because an alone evo executioner can actually full counter a hog rider if you play it early enough. And also when you have the Evo snowball, you can just throw things back. So if you're facing like a big golem push, you don't have enough DPS to really take it down that quickly. But if you throw it back with the Evo snowball, you just buy yourself so much more time and put yourself in a really good spot. This guy does unfortunately have Sparky, but we do have our lightning, so I think we'll actually be okay. Yeah, that was a really nice lightning right there. He does go in for the Goblin Giant, which I have like no elixir to stop. Okay, this is bad. This is very bad. Get another hit, ghost. Oh, I didn't get another hit. Okay, I was kind of aggressive right there cycling my executioner, guys. I'd probably normally wait more until double elixir in this sort of matchup, but I just don't feel like waiting. I'll barber onto his spear goblins. Yeah, so in this sort of match up against Sparky, it's actually probably going to be a lot better for us than double elixir, but you know, I'm I'm not really the type of player that likes waiting too much just cuz I'm making a video and stuff. I don't just feel like doing nothing. So, yeah, we're just going to play even though it's single elixir right now. It will be double elixir pretty soon here though to be fair. Oh, nice. Beautiful lightning value. That's exactly what I wanted right there, guys. To be able to hit a nice goblin giant right there along with the Sparky. All right. Hopefully, we're able to get some stuff down that we need right here. Get a barrel, please. This is kind of bad. Bandit died as well. I'm going to have to snowball here, but we're not looking good. Oh, wait. Evo Snowball resets the Sparky, bro. Also, why is this guy such a pest, man? He keeps on spamming. Like, every time he has like 0.1 elixir, he keeps on spamming these bats, this goblin gang, some some other annoying thing ability. Okay, decent ability right there. We're going to get some nice double damage with this, I guess, but I don't know how well we're going to do here. Hopefully, we can end up doing something. Come on, executioner. Okay. Okay. Executioner is still alive, guys. And we do take out everything. Okay. Let's just go in for a ram rider. He wasted his zap, I think. So, this could be pretty hard for him to stall, actually. Nice. Okay, we get a Ram Rider connection right there. We're going to get another executioner as well right here. Okay. Okay, we take that out. Beautiful executioner. Oh my gosh, guys. What an executioner right there. We actually have a chance to come back in this matchup now. despite the really bad start and everything. I could go in for a ram rider, but I feel like it's not worth it to go in for it alone because then he would just uh get a free counter push probably. Going to go for my Evo execution right here. And I think this guy's not breaking through this. He's probably going to set up with the Sparky in a second here. Yeah, of course he would, man. Nice. He goes for the spear goblins right there, which we kind of just waste the I don't know what you want to call it, the value of, I suppose. I don't know. Anyways, we can just evo snowball right here on all of this junk. We do reset the sparky and everything, which is pretty nice. Nice. The executioner barely killed that. And executioner is going to kill the miner as well. Okay, it does go in for a sparky here. Bandit does dash on the tower, though. Wait, executioner. Executioner. I cannot believe we stole that. And finally, guys, the number one deck to push to ultimate champion with, I would say, has to be this modern balloon deck. It's just been so good right now because I feel like a lot of the meta decks have just really been lacking in air defense. They always seem to forget air and that makes this deck really, really good. Even if you can't get a balloon connection against some people, all you have to do is just get balloon death damage constantly. You don't actually need the big balloon hit. just need the little bits of death damage and eventually you uh chip them out usually or you get some minor chip as well on their tower. You know, maybe I could have sent in a minor right there on the inferno tower, but I will next time when I actually know he has it in cycle. All right, that's an inside barrel. I'm going to go for my bar burrow. With barbarian barrel, you have to be really careful to actually catch those goblin barrels cuz they try to kind of switch up the placement just a little bit and it's not quite as lot um quite as wide as the log. So, it's sometimes easy to miss it by just a tile and you let one of those goblins survive. But yeah, we have to get our Evo musketeer as well in this matchup for sure. That's going to really help us out once we get an evolved musketeer down somewhere on the field. Oh, he does have the dark goblin. So, that probably means he has no rocket. Not really sure how I feel about that actually. I feel like it would be easier if he had rocket cuz dark goblin is pretty annoying. Oh, that was such a bad goblin gang by this guy. Musketeer is unfortunately dead though. I think what I'm going to do here is balloon. And I know he's going to go for his inferno tower onto it, but I'm just going to let it happen. Let the balloon actually tank and then I'll go for my miner just to get some chip on the tower while he's distracted. Not really the best for us, but got to do what you got to do. I kind of have to bar this, but I have my Evo skeletons, so I think I'll be okay. Nice. We actually get right on that. Okay, let's just go for this right here. Get this off as well. Okay, we defend that perfectly. Nice. I just wanted to keep my evil musketeer in cycle, guys. I think it's actually kind of worth it that I save that instead of using it on the musketeer. I mean on on his princess is what I meant to say. Oh, that's a barbarl for sure. Beautiful barrel value. Dude, why is this guy overprotecting his princess so much, bro? This guy's literally just protecting his princess for no reason every time. All right, now we have our evil musketeer again in cycle. So, we have another opportunity to make a good push. This is getting really annoying though cuz I have to evil musketeer on like a dark goblin on an inferno tower on a princess. There's so many different things I can go for it on. All right, we do get the inferno tower right here. That might take it out with the snowball. Yeah, it's going to take most of it out. Yeah, it takes it out. Okay, perfect. And skeletons should kill this. Dang, I still get nothing out of that. Bro, there's no way. This matchup is actually so annoying, but we're making the most of it so far. We could just go for a snowball onto his barrel. Going to counter it fully. You could kind of afford to waste your bar barrel sometimes because you always know that uh you're going to be covered with your other troops against their barrels. And the guys also evoskeletons can always fully counter the barrel. So yeah, you have a you have a few options. We do get a nice snowball on the dark goblin which might allow us to get a balloon hit. We do get one big balloon hit. Evo skills are going crazy on his knight as well. Nice. We're playing really really well so far. He's probably going to get a princess down soon though, I'm assuming. Just going to spam him a little bit right here with this. Get this off. Just defend the princess cheaply instead of overcommitting onto it. And this guy's in big trouble. Oh, nice. His dark goblin does get taken out right there by the miner. We get a barber off on this. We just can snowball his spear goblins away. And I think we just meticulously took this guy down. Wow, that was a nice game. [Music]"

    "title": "Top 20 BEST Decks in Clash Royale (May 2025)",
    "creator": "Vlakx",
    "transcript": "Tired of losing trophies because your deck sucks? Don't worry, because in this video, I am revealing the top 20 decks in Clash Royale for the May season. Let's start. So, at number 20, we have this 3.6 elixir mortar deck. This deck features the new witch evolution, which is obviously overpowered. Use your mortars and miners offensively to get damage. All the swarms in this deck can be used to counter your opponent's push, as well as complement the skeleton king's ability. This deck doesn't have a big spell, so you need to cycle a lot of miners. To make your minor push even more effective, pair it with a swarm. You can bait out a small spell from your opponent using a swarm card and then hit them with a minor plus goblin gang push. Don't hesitate to play your mortars on defense if needed. If your opponent has lightning, make sure to space out your witch and mortar. This deck is quite wellrounded in terms of offense and defense, and it's relatively easy to play, too. At number 19, we have the Pekka Bridge spam. Pekka just got some insane buffs which makes this classic deck a good choice. The electro wizard and magic archer can deal with air units while the bandit and royal ghost are great for applying pressure. Use these cards to bait out your opponent's counters to your battle ram. A Pekka plus evolved battle ram push can be hard to stop if you also use your zap effectively. If you're finding it hard to break through, you may need to use your magic archer on the bridge to get some sneaky damage. Use your poison spell to counter defensive cards your opponent deploys. Now, I do think that this deck can struggle against the evolved witch, but since most players don't have her yet, you should be good. This deck has a great offensive potential, but it's neither free-to-play friendly nor the easiest to play. Next up at number 18, we have this very fast 2.8 elixir log bait deck. The Goblin Barrel Evolution is probably amongst the top three evos in the game right now. The Valkyrie is the perfect addition to this deck over the knight because of how strong the witch is in the meta. The Valkyrie and Princess can deal with a witch and any other offensive threat. The Dark Goblin is annoying and will most likely always force out a small spell. That will be your chance to go allin with wall breakers and Goblin Barrel. Cannon and ice spirits will be your best answers against any cycle or beat down push. You don't have a big spell in this deck. Therefore, it's extremely important to cycle back to your evolved goblin barrel as quickly as possible and apply dual lane pressure. This free-to-play deck is rated highly on offense and defense despite not being the easiest to use. But you know what's easy? Hitting that like and subscribe button. At number 17, we have the 2.9 Royal Hogs Earthquake Cycle. Most of you should be familiar with this deck considering it's been the best Clash Royale deck for the last 2 years or so. The three card cycle with the archer queen makes the offense of this deck practically impossible to stop. If played right, you can beat any matchup with this deck. You can spam Royal Hogs and Earthquake so quickly in double and triple elixir. The great thing about this deck is how it allows your mistakes to go unnoticed, and that's because of its godly defense. The Royal Delivery is the most underrated defensive card in the game. When paired with cards like Archer Queen, Log, and Cannon, it can stop any upcoming push. This is quite a high skill deck, but give it a shot because it's really easy to upgrade. Next up at number 16, we have this high skill Royal Giant deck. This is a classic deck which has been around for years now. The monk is especially underrated in this deck as he can deflect all projectiles coming towards your Royal Giant. The fisherman is a big asset to this deck since he can pull away heavy damage dealing troops like Pekka away from your Royal Giant. The Hunter Revolution can be the gamecher in this deck because his single attack can immobilize enemy troops. Use this to your advantage and deploy him directly behind your Royal Giant. This is a really high skill deck, but not that difficult to upgrade. Now, at number 15, we have this minor balloon cycle deck. This is a really high skill deck, but it also has tons of outplay potential. Pair your miner and balloon together to create a devastating push. You can get creative with your minor placements. either drop him on the tower or you can also deploy him directly on the enemy defensive troops or buildings. This way you can ensure that your balloon gets a hit and deals massive damage. Ice Golem can be used to kite troops as well as to provide an extra tank for your balloon. Musketeer and Bomb tower are your main defensive units, so protect them at all costs and space them out to not give your opponent spell value. This free-to-play deck is wellrounded on both offense and defense, but it's quite tricky to use. Next up at number 14, we have this giant graveyard deck. Now, this is a fairly simple deck to use. A giant and graveyard push is really hard to stop if you don't have the right counters. The bowler is the anti-meta card in this deck to take care of all the annoying witches or hog riders. Use your snowball to either defend against an upcoming push or you can use it on offense to slow down the opponent's tower. The witch and guards will be your heavy damage dealing troops on defense. Make sure to not drop them together. Once your opponent has wasted a spell on one of them, feel free to drop the other. Be extra offensive in double and triple elixir and don't be afraid to tower trade. This deck is relatively easy to upgrade and is highly rated on offense, too. So, at number 13, we have this graveyard deck. To play graveyard, you need only one thing, patience. Always play reactively and rely on building good counter pushes. Remember, the defense of this deck is unbreakable, so use that to your advantage and build positive elixir trades. Goblin Stein, Ice Wizard, Cannon, and of course, the Tornado. All these cards give incredible defensive value. Defend cheaply and then drop a knight in front of your surviving troops to build a counter push with a graveyard. Don't drop your graveyard until you've figured out what counters your opponent has. Otherwise, this mistake can make you lose early on. This deck gets full marks on its defensive value, although you may have a hard time upgrading it. At number 12, we have this new Royal Recruits Hog Rider deck. Despite having the recruits in this deck, this deck costs only 3.6 elixir. Use your wall breakers to bait out the opponent's spells and counters to your hog. You can even apply dual lane pressure by splitting royal recruits and dropping the wall breakers in one lane and the hog rider in the other. This deck is purely arrows bait. Firecracker, goblin gang, and guards. All of them can be used to bait out arrows. Once the arrows are out, it becomes really difficult to stock the remaining cards and the wall breakers. The Mighty Miner is your best card to deal against heavy tanks as your other cards can be taken out by spells. Apply enough pressure and double and triple elixir since this deck doesn't run a big spell. This is definitely one of the easiest decks you can upgrade and play. Next up at number 11, we have this Mega Knight spam deck. Mega Knight was, is, and will continue to be in meta now that his evolution is extremely strong. This deck relies on overwhelming your opponent with Mega Knight plus Sprints so that your wall breakers and bandit can sneak through to get damage. If your opponent doesn't have a small spell in hand, the Goblin Gang, Evolved Bats, and Wall Breakers will make your push even more deadly. The Archer Queen is your best response to air, so protect her always against Lava Hound decks. Keep your arrows handy all the time to take care of swarms. This is a heavy offensive deck, but it may struggle against cycle decks a bit. At number 10, we have this never seen before Ram rider deck featuring the new broken champion boss Bandit. This deck came out of nowhere and suddenly trending. It has a very high offensive potential with most cards in this deck being punish cards. Royal Ghost and Bandit can be used to bait out certain responses from your opponent, but it's the boss bandit that makes the defense tricky for your opponent. It's quite unpredictable and most players are still not accustomed to defending against her. Now add the charge from the Ram Rider and your opponent will eventually crumble from all this pressure. The deck's defense relies solely on the evolved executioner, but since he's beyond broken, it's more than enough. While you may have to break your bank in order to max this deck, it might actually be worth it. Next up at number nine, we have the classic 3.0 Expo. It shouldn't be a surprise that Expo is unreal right now considering it finished number one in the world just a month ago. While you may need to have an insane amount of skill to play the decks perfectly, Expo can beat most matchups if you do everything right. However, one mistake and you're cooked. The key thing to playing this deck is to know when to play your expo and when to protect it. Don't overspend elixir defending a nearly dead expo. Instead, save elixir to deploy another one. You have to outcycle the opponent's counters to your expo. So, it's really important that you don't overcommit elixir if it gets really hard to break through. Defend throughout the game and just fireball cycle your opponent. 3.0 Expo is a tough deck to play, but also quite free to play. At number eight, we have the Goblin Giant Sparky. Forget about defense with this one because this deck is a three crown machine. One good Goblin Giant Sparky push will win you the game. Your only struggle will be against Rocket and Royal Recruit decks, else you can beat anything. This deck is incredibly easy to play. Just Goblin Giant in the back and continue building a good push behind it. To apply even more pressure, you can also deploy your elite barbarians in the opposite lane. This forces your opponent to choose which lane to defend, but eventually they'll have to defend both because if they don't, either push can three crown them easily. Not only is this deck quite easy to play, it's also pocket friendly to upgrade. Now, at number seven, we have this Royal Recruits Piggies deck. This is perhaps the easiest deck to play in the game. Split your recruits, split your Royal Hogs, and Flying Machine in the middle. Simple. And for defense, you have the godly trio of the Zabies, Goblin Cage, and Recruits. It's a really annoying deck to face, and your opponent will eventually get overwhelmed by all the pressure. During a match, it's important for you to recognize the counters to your Royal Hogs. If they have a fireball or a splash damage cards, you may want to split your Royal Hogs. If not, then dropping them all in the same lane might be better. This is the most free-to-play deck of this list. easiest to use and extremely reliable on both offense and defense. At number six, we have this bridge spam deck. This deck is all about offense. Your job is to create a lot of pressure using split lane pushes. Split bandit, royal ghost, and battle ram on both the lanes and watch your opponents struggle. The Archer Queen is your main defense against beat down and air troops. Keep placing as many elixir collectors as you can. You can even use your barbarians to bait out a big spell like fireball so that you can protect your collector. If you have two or more collectors down on the field, you've basically won the game. This deck doesn't have much defense but gets a high score on offense. At number five, we have this new Royal Giant deck featuring the evolved witch. This deck has been trending on top ladder recently, and the reason for that is its unbelievable defensive potential. Fisherman, Zappies, Tombstone, and now add the Evolved Witch to this lineup. Good luck getting through all these defensive cards. The Tombstone not only acts as a defensive building, but it also complements the evolved witch and skeleton king's ability. Fisherman is the MVP of this deck because it can pull troops attacking your Royal Giant as well as help with King tower activation. Lightning can clear the way for your Royal Giant to get some good damage. This deck costs 4.1 elixir, which makes it quite heavy. So, you need to cycle your cards with proper strategy and not spam them without thought. I would rate this deck well on the defensive scale, although it might not be the most free-to-play deck ever. At number four, we have this minor rocket deck. While this deck may appear quite normal at first glance, it's not until you realize that it's just 2.6 elixir, which makes it really strong. Imagine getting miners and rockets thrown at your tower rapidly and there's nothing you can do about it. This deck does the same, which is why it's a favorite amongst pros. The Knight and Cannon are enough for defense as long as you're not facing Laval Loon. Air decks can definitely give this deck a hard time, but you should be able to beat any other matchup most of the time. This deck is extremely easy to upgrade, but also requires really high skill to play. Next at number three, we have the newly updated Golden Knight Hog Earthquake Deck. With two reworks, Hog EQ has received a total upgrade. The Golden Knight is stronger than ever, but it's the Goblin Hut that serves as the true MVP. The newly reworked hut is great against any upcoming push and is finally viable after all these years. The evolved firecracker is annoying to deal with, and you can use it to get a lot of burst damage from the bridge. Costing just 2.8 eight elixir. This deck can cycle hog riders extremely fast, making it hard to defend against. Moreover, it's quite free to play and has an incredible offensive potential. At number two, we have this minor boss bandit deck. Minor Poison has always been the most reliable deck in the game, and with the wall breakers, it becomes even stronger. The boss bandit is just too broken and can win you games single-handedly. This entire deck revolves around forcing your opponent into negative elixir trades and bad cycles. You can do this either by spamming the boss bandit or by using miner and wall breakers together. The spear goblins serve as a spellbait for the evolved bats which can deal heavy damage when paired with a minor. This deck receives a high score across everything except that it's a bit difficult to upgrade. And finally at number one as the best deck in Clash Royale, we have Lava Loon. Now Lava Loon is an anti-a deck which means it can basically beat anything, even the hardest of matchups. It's relatively easy to play but tough to upgrade. It's also the best deck for Valkyrie evolution in Clash Royale. But do you want to know what are the best cards for other evolutions too? Then click on this video."

    "creator": "Surgical Goblin [ENG]",
    "transcript": "Yo, what's up guys? S Roland here. Welcome to this new episode. In today's video, we're going to be playing with the top three best players in their walter deck. Starting with rank number three, Riley. Definitely a really famous and well-known player. Ranked number three with this Royal Hawks quick cycle deck with the arch queen. In my opinion, this deck is super solid in the current meta. seen many other pro players use it. Let's see what we can get going with it in today's video. And by the way, please do not ask me. Search what happened to your medals. I know guys, I tilted and lost so many medals. It's actually insane. Yesterday I was ranked. I think it was top 25 in the world after I got done with the games and today I'm ranked like 300 something in the world. It's actually so sad. Like I don't even want to talk about it. Okay, looks like we are going to be facing no minor poison. I'm telling you guys, today I'm getting some crazy unlucky matchups and just in general some very unfortunate interactions as well. Like bomb tower when using Royal Hogs. Who uses bomb tower? I put royal hogs and of course I'm facing bomb tower. Okay, anyways, let's try to focus up. Let's see what um other cards he's missing. I'm going to Okay, let's see if he goes with spear go. Let's lock the left side. definitely going to cycle Archer Queen in a lane where he's not going to be pressuring because if not um he's just going to get poison value and he's just slowly but surely going to get more and more chip damage on the left side tower. Okay, nice good ice square. Not sure why he would go miner into the cannon just feeding us more more cannon value right there. Let's in the meantime have the arch queen ability ready and let's actually go with the royal hawks. Nice. Is he going to have enough elixir for Yeah, I don't think he's going to have enough elixir for the bomb tower. Okay, let's go with a lock here. We are going to take a lot of damage ourself as well with the wall breakers. Who's going to win the trade though? Okay, I think yeah, we're going to win the trade. Like quite some damage. I'm kind of happy with it. Could have been better for us, but not bad either because we did end up getting a lot of chip damage considering that he has bomb tower. It's not going to be easy to break through his defense. So, the fact that we already got so much damage early on definitely a really good thing for us to be honest. Okay, let's go with the earthquake to continue getting more and more damage. We might even be um getting to a point where you might need to spell cycle him. Let's go with the Eva ice taking care of the bits. And let's definitely try to get the three card cycle going by cycling Archer Queen here into the the opposite lane. Okay, what can we do to win this match? I mean, I'm going to try and out cycle him. We do have a very quick cycle to be honest, so I think we might be able to at some point out cycle him. Okay, we need to be careful with his pressure cards as well. Okay, let's go with evil cannon trying to take care of the spirit of lines and it's afterwards. I'm going to wait for the wall breakers. He's probably going to go wall breakers, right? Yeah, there you go. Beautiful delivery. Is it going to Okay, it's not going to take care of all the bets. And man, I think I misclicked the arch queen into the left side lane. It should have gone right side lane right there. Not giving him more poison value. I'm telling you guys, today is just not my day. Like, I'm playing super bad and in general also having some some unfortunate interactions. Okay, let's see. I need to try and out cycle him. I think we outcycle him here. Nice. Let's go with Rohogs quickly. Cannon up height to take care of the walls. And I think we win right. Yeah, I think we win right here, guys. Wait a second. Okay, 300 HP Earthquake to try and get the damage. We're missing one more Earthquake. Okay, I think we got it. If we don't make a big mistake here, we definitely got it. Nice ice break even jumps. He's probably going to go with like wall breakers, bets, whatever he goes with. delivery is going to get a lot of value and we do cycle back to earthquake. Okay, I would say pretty good. A few mistakes here and there, but still we are going to secure the victory. See you guys soon with game number two. Okay guys, hopping into match number two. We are going to finally get a victory. Man, I'm telling you guys that today has been such a rough day for me. I do want to apologize if uh all of the sudden such a big change between being like ranked number 25 in the world and now playing in like rank number 300 in the world. It's definitely a big change for sure. Okay, what are we going to be facing here? Looks like he has goblins. Goblins plus LO. Could be psycho deck. Could maybe be like Okay, looks like he also has earthquake. Probably going to be Hulk Rider, I think. Most of the times with goblins, it's a hog rider deck. If you see skeletons plus like arch queen, it's going to be um Okay, looks like he also has a monk monk. Goblins and the earthquake. Don't think I faced his deck before. Let's see what he's going to be running. Let's see if he's going to support the the monk with something. I'm going to try and kind of hold on to my arch cool ability because I feel like he's going to probably pop his monk ability, right? Yeah, there you go. There's the monk ability. Definitely um expected to be honest. Okay, let's see, guys. Let's see what he's going to do. Looks like he has a Tesla monk firecracker. Okay, let's go with a cannon here. He might go for earthquake. Let's be careful with that. Okay, delivery plus skeleton. Still going to take one hit, but I think we might be able to get something going here with the arch queen because I feel like he spent a lot of elixir just now. Okay, ability goblins are going to go down fast. Arch queen is still alive. Royal delivery is tanking. It's going to be so much damage. Nice. Beautiful play right there. We are going to take the hog right ahead, but look at the amount of damage this guy just took from the arch queen at the bridge right there. No monk can cycle either. Not a lot of elixir for him to defend it. Royal Hogs here to pressure as soon as possible knowing that he's low on elixir. Beautiful play so far. Okay, looking good, guys. I mean, he has Monk, he has Hulk Rider Earthquake. Not an easy matchup to to deal with considering that we have Archer Queen considering that our defense against the the Hog Rider is not like easy at all. Okay, let's go with Skeletors here to take care of the Firecracker. Hog Rider is once again going to get a connection. But overall situation, the fact that we got so much damage is definitely really, really good for us. Okay, I think we might have to earthquake cycle, but at the same time, I'm definitely going to try and keep up the pressure with the Royal Hogs because if we do end up um yeah, forcing out elixir from him defensively, it's of course even better for us. Okay, be careful with the firecracker at the bridge. If he does want to try and get some chit damage to say instead, he goes with the firecracker in the back. And let's actually cycle lock right here. He's probably going to pop his ability. Okay, nice ability actually. Okay, let's go with delivery. Oh, wait, what? Okay, I'm not really sure what just happened right there, but the arch queen somehow didn't target the monk. Instead, it killed the firecracker. It damaged the hog rider a lot, and it actually just ended up getting so much value right there. Beautiful, guys. Looking good. I mean, if we just cycle two more earthquakes, two more logs. I think we already do enough damage to take his tower. And looking at our tower, it's also looking very well. Okay, let's have the cannon going right here to take care of the firecracker. We do need to be careful with the with the hog rider right now. But I mean, we have arch queen which is not going to die to the hog to the monog. Let's go with a delivery here as well. Ice spirit up high just in case he goes with a firecracker. And anyways, we're just going to yeah have to spell cycle a little bit more to take his left side tower. So let's go with earthquake. Let's go with a rock. And there you go. We're going to take his left side tower. Beautiful game play right there. This is the rank number three deck in the world right now. Let's quickly switch to the rank number two deck in the world. Is quite a toxic deck. I do want to apologize for that. Yesterday, I also uploaded a recruits deck. I'm not going to, of course, um, yeah, change the deck. I'm just going to straight up copy the deck, which is currently rank number two, and it's actually going to be Ren Rider with the Executioner. I thought it was the other deck. Rank number one is actually recruits deck. So, you guys got to wait a little bit more to see that one. See you guys soon with game number three. Okay, let's go, guys. Hopping into match number three with deck number two. Let's see what we're going to be facing here. This deck has also been very popular, very strong recently. I've seen many people, yeah, getting a lot of wins, getting high on letter with this deck. Okay, let's actually go with Executioner always lane just in case he has like a poison, maybe even a rocket. I don't know, like some people use different spells in the minor deck. So, always be uh yeah, careful cycling, for example, the executioner in the deck. Interesting skeleton king. I'm not sure if the executioner is going to walk up enough. No, unfortunately, it's not going to walk up enough, but still pretty um decent situation for us. He's going to be running the goblin hut here. Okay. Unfortunately, we didn't have the barbell quite in cycle. Let's go with a barbell right now. And let's see what he's going to be running. Okay. Can we get a snowball to take care of the witch? Let's see. Oh, he also has skeletons. Okay. Skeletons witch. Ice spirit skeleton king. What is his deck? Okay. I don't think I've ever faced his deck before. It's going to be very interesting to see what are the cards he's missing. The fact that we have Okay, let's go with Executioner here. Trying to take care of the skeletons. hopefully being able to damage the witches one. He has a lightning. Okay, lightning minor goblin huts. Okay, very interesting deck right here. Definitely a deck which I never seen before. Surprises me. Catches me off offguard a little bit. But anyways, I think we still uh should be fine if we do end up how do you say that? Like recovering from this situation. Okay, he goes with a skeleton king once again. Let's go with a Bennett here. So he has skeletons, he has goblin hut. Need to be careful with giving him too much value. But the fact that we have lightning is also going to be very nice. Um against for example his evil witch against the golden hut in some situations could be helpful as well. There you go. Talking about the evil witch, he does go with the witch already. He's going to go with skeletons to distractor. Definitely going to go with a lightning here to take care of the evil witch. And let's see what he's going to do um to defend the boss bender. Let's go with the evil snowball here as well. Hopefully that can get a connection. But unfortunately he does get the skeleton king down in time. Man, he has a lot of destruction units. He has golden hut, witch, skeletons, minor, skeleton king. I feel like it's not going to be easy to break through his defense, but I'm going to try and do my best to to make a potential comeback right here. Okay, let's go with a royal ghost to keep out of the pressure. Let's go with a bandit here as well. Not sure what he has in cycle right now to deal with it. I'm going to light the the goblin hut plus the witch just to take care of it instantly. Execution is actually going to lock to the miner and the tower. Only one connection, though, but still every damage counts, guys. Definitely. Um, yeah, nice to finally get some decent damage here. Okay, let's have the snowball ready. Looks like he does go with the witch. Let's go with a a snowball here to try and take care of the skeleton king. More skeletons from him. And we need to be careful with this evil witch, guys. Okay, probably just going to lightning this one or these ones. Don't really want to risk it to be honest. I feel like if I wouldn't lightning there, those witches are just never going to die. I rather uh play safe than than be sorry afterwards. Okay, knowing that he has lightning going to cycle execution opposite lane. Let's go with executioner towards the left side. Is he going to go? Okay, let's go with snowball here. Not the best snowball, but it is still going to I guess knock back the the miner a little bit. Let's go with a ghost as well and let's see what he's going to do. Okay, evil witch here. Let's go with a lightning as soon as possible. We are going to take care of that. Looks like the ghost might be able to get a bit of damage there. Nice. Ghost is actually still alive. It's going to get quite some damage here. Okay, let's have the executioner ready as well. Let's go with XC. Trying to take care of most of the skeletons. Let's go with a barbell here as well. And let's go with a ghost just to yeah, get some extra splash damage. And slowly but surely getting more and more damage, guys. This is actually looking pretty good for us. Let's go with a boss bandit. Let's have the the evil snowball ready as well. Can we break through his defense? Let's go with a lightning. Okay, lightning right here. Boss is still quite healthy. Um, ghost is also getting a lot of damage on the right side tower. Nice. Looking good. Can we take care of the witch? Let's see if the barbell can take care of it. Nice guys. Beautiful. Okay, slowly but surely getting more and more damage. Let's go with the rim rider and let's have the lightning ready. He goes with the lightning. Very aggressive in my opinion. Okay, nice prediction for anything he drops against the rim rider. Looks like the rim rider is going to get a connection. All we need to do right now is just cycle the lightning. Lightning is going to do enough. Let's cycle better. Let's go with the ghost. And lightning I believe does enough. If it doesn't enough, we also have the snowball ready, but looks like it does indeed do enough damage. What a crazy deck from him. Honestly, minor quick cycle. Lightning witch. Not a deck I've seen at all. So far caught me off guard a little bit in the beginning. That's also why he got so much damage. And then afterwards, we were able to make the comeback and actually get um yeah, a very nice victory. Okay, looks like we're up against a guy called Ruskov. I do know him. I believe he's a French content creator. I'm pretty sure he he's a French uh streamer. Okay, let's go with ghost. Let's go with a boss blet. We are going to take quite some damage from the right side wallaker. And let's quickly go with a boss band ability here. Trying to take um get some damage on the ice wizard. Okay, beautiful. Let's actually go with a rim ready here as well. I feel like the boss plus the ghost are going to take care of the cannon on time. Boss Bennett even dashes to the tower and that's going to be a lot of damage right there guys. Nice, beautiful start. Beautiful, beautiful start right there. Very good situation for us already on in the match. And by the way, what is his deck? Interesting deck from him. He has skeletons, ice wizard, lightning. It's like a minor psycho deck with lightning. What is happening, guys? Why everyone is all of the sudden using lightning? I'm telling you guys that today has been like a crazy day for me. Luckwise, I feel like we have been um getting some unlucky matchups so far. Why does this guy all of the sudden is running lightning when I'm having executioner? Anyways, I think the executioner is not even going to be that good in a in a matchup like this. Probably not even going to use it that much to be honest. Okay, let's go with the boss bandit here towards the left side. Let's have the ghost in case he wants to pressure with the wall breakers. I think he has evil wall breakers available right now. So, we definitely need to be yeah kind of careful with that. Okay, looks like he does go with skeletons. There you go. There's the evil wall breakers. So, let's go with a ghost. And let's also go with a barbell just to make sure we actually don't uh yeah take any unnecessary damage. And let's also go with a bandit here. I feel like the bandit plus the boss bandit in many situations can can get a lot of value and sometimes also a good amount of damage. Okay, so no cannon cycle. Should I go with Ram Rider? I think I'm going to go Ren Rider as soon as the ice wizard locks onto the tower just to prevent that the ice wizard is actually going to um yeah freeze and slow down the Rider. Let's also go with evil snowball. Hopefully the Ramire is able to get the one connection. Unfortunately, no hit at all. Probably should have done a prediction right there. Okay, let's go with Xi at the bridge knowing that he has lightning. He already showed it. Want to try and not give him any tower um get damage for free. Waller is not going to get a connection. So, good for us. That's in the meantime. Psycho boss Bennett in the back right here. Okay, Bennett here as well. Looking pretty good. He's probably going to go with skeletons, right? Okay, let's go with a barbell. Let's also go with a ram rider right here. And let's see how he's going to defend this. Need to be careful with the wall breaker. Definitely going to have to snowball those if I don't want to take any unnecessary damage. Look at the Rembrandt though. Rembrandt is going to still force out the lock and still gets a connection. What? Oh my god, that's insane. That interaction was actually insane for us. Okay, finally a good interaction, guys. I cannot complain anymore in today's video after that interaction right there. Interesting lighting from him. Not the best one to be honest. Okay, nice, beautiful lighting from us and I think this is going to be good game to be honest. or let's see how he's going to defend it, but I don't think he will be able to. Let's see. No, even the NATO is not going to be enough. Very uh yeah, good pressure on us. Way too much spam cards, way too much pressure cards for him to deal with. Also, he didn't have any, how do you say that? Um ground jun like he didn't have a knight, no Valkyrie, no tank, and us having ghost bandit boss bended. Just way too many spam cards, way too many pressure cards for him to deal with. So, so far doing very well, guys. Rank number three, two 20. Rank number two, two 20 two. Now it's time to play with the rank number one in the world deck. And I already kind of spoiled it. It's going to be a Royal Recruits deck. Yesterday I uploaded a video with Royal Recruits as well, but with a different version with the Hog Rider. Today we're going to end today's video with this Royal Recruit spam deck. Let's see what we can get going with it. And oh my god, I'm actually going to be facing Henry Gamer. He's actually a friend of mine. Okay, let's give him the the good luck. And let's see what he's going to be running. I think if I'm not wrong, he likes to play like psycho decks, hog rider or sometimes he likes to play um royal giant. Okay, lo still could be anything. It could be royal giant. It could be psycho deck or maybe he's using something else. But most of the times when I've seen him play, he's always using um yeah, royal giant or or what's it called? Or psycho decks. Okay, let's go with dark. Let's go with Golden Gang right side. Let's wait and see what he's going to do. Looks like he goes with a witch. which is going to be very annoying for us to deal with. But also, we have a lot of pressure cards. We have a lot of spam cards. So, if we pressure well and if we manage to kind of play around his cycle, I think we should also be able to yeah, be annoying and get a lot of value. Okay, let's go with Warers. Let's see what he's going to do about it. Looks like he does go with a ghost. Is he going to tank the left side? Okay, pretty good decision from him. Hopefully, he's not going to prediction lock us here. Nice. Okay, goblins plus the the deradish are going to take care of the ghost very quickly. The fact that we have dagger dashes against roller giant, I'm not sure about it either. Okay, let's see what we can get going here. Okay, nice witch by him. Let's go with a dark. Man, this is going to be scary. I feel like we can just not deal with the witch. It's going to be so hard for us to kill it. Okay, let's go with recruits and let's go with gobl. He's probably going to lock the right side. There you go. So, he's not going to have any elixir right now to to defend the left side at least. Can we take care of the witch though? That's the real question. I need to get a mighty miner going on top of the witch to take care of her. Okay. Oh man, this is going to be a rough one. How can I deal with the witch? I might have to fireball this. Please just fireball kill it. Okay, there you go. We are going to kill it. But man, this is looking scary and looking difficult for us. Is it going to go royal giant? What is he going to do, man? The evil witch is going to be so hard for us to kill. You guys just saw how much value she got. Um yeah, on that one push on the right side and he knows he already starts start cycling the witch. He knows that the evil witch is going to be like his main win condition, main kind of card for for him to get the damage. Okay, let's go with dark goblin here. He's probably going to go with a log as soon as I play it. Let's go with a goblin gang. And let's also go with a fireball afterwards. Okay, lo goblins right here to take care of the witch. And man, this is going to be not easy, but I think we can do it, guys. Let's go with skeleton barrel. Let's call the evil Wiggers here as well. We need to try and keep out the pressure as much as possible. Nice. Wiggers are going to get a lot of damage. Skeleton's looking one as well. Dark Goblin is not going to get onto the tower though. We need to be careful here. Okay. Can I take care of the witch somehow? I wonder how I can kill her. Okay. Maybe plus golden gang. It's not going to be enough, man. Okay. I think we just lost. Unless we can somehow take the tower. Can we take the tower here with the wall breakers? The dark goblin maybe. Please dark goblin. No, dark is not going to lock on and we are going to unfortunately lose the king tower right here. Man, what a close match. Evil witch just being way too overpowered. We didn't really have a way Yeah. of killing her. I tried to kill her with the fireball. I tried to drop like I think it was fireball goblin gang seven elixir and still no way of killing her. Such a strong card right now. Still almost won though. Definitely well played by us but also really well played by Henry. So, see you guys soon with the last match of today's video. Okay, guys. Hoping into the last match of today's video. Unfortun right there against the Royal Giant. Defending was no option. So, I had to try and go all in right there with the wall breakers, with the with the what's it called? With the dark goblin, with the fireball. I just had to I knew I had to try and somehow take the tower because if not, it would have definitely been impossible. Okay, let's go with the mighty miner. Right side. Let's go with the goblin gang split here as well. Looks like we are going to be facing electrogine. So, electroshine is actually going to be quite annoying, quite difficult. But the good thing about our deck is that we have so many spam cards, so many pressure cards to the point where often even though we don't have a great defensive answer, our pressure cards can kind of resolve and often win us the matchup. Okay, he has also mother witch. Man, mother witch, why why are we facing mother witch plus electric giant? Okay, he is going to activate the king tower, but still not the perfect tornado placement. is going to still take a lot of damage right there. Unfortunate matchups right here which evolution ro giant quick cycle and now electrogiant plus mother witch. Can I comp complain guys? I guess after the the earlier interaction I said that I I cannot complain anymore. So that's exactly what I'm going to be doing. Not going to complain. Just going to try and be as positive as possible. Okay, let's go with recruits right here. He's probably going to go with um electrogine sometime soon. I feel like I'm going to try and keep on the pressure as much as possible. I'm going to probably have to fireball the the mother witch. Okay, let's go with dark goblin here. Let's wait a little bit. If he goes with the mother witch instead, he goes with a bomber for now. Okay, let's go with a goblin gang split and let's have the fireball ready as soon as I have four elixir. I'm definitely going to have to to kill her because if not, we yeah just going to get so much value out of the mother witch. Okay, he also has dark prince, man. He has Bulmer, Dark Prince, Mother Witch, so many splash cards, and he's still so far not able to deal with this without taking any damage. Like, that's actually crazy. The fact that he has Mother Witch, NATO, Dark Prince, Bomber, and we still have his tower at 1,800 HP is definitely yeah, insane to me. Okay, let's go with the skeleton barrel. Looks like he does go with a Phoenix. Not sure if that was a Phoenix prediction, but definitely yeah, well played by him. And the counter push here is going to be scary, guys. Okay, let's go with a dark goblin here. Let's wait a little bit. Definitely going to have to get the recruits going. Looks like he does go with a NATO. Let's have the goblin ging ready here as well. And I'm going to also have to go with the goblins. Alex giant here is just going to get so much value, so much damage as well. Okay, can we still win this somehow? That's the real question. Okay, mighty miner here to try and tank. Let's go with a dark goblin up high to hopefully snipe the mother witch. Please kill her. Just need her to Yeah. go away. Get her off the field as soon as possible. Mighty Miner to tank for the dark opposite lane. Let's go with the skeleton bell here as well. And I might have to try and pressure a lot opposite lane. Okay, fireball here to try and take care of the mother witch. Nice. Skeletons are going to look into the tower for a lot of damage. Wait a second. How is he going to deal with the wall breakers? Okay, darkens is not a bad option, but still lot of elixir force defensively. Let's see if we can clutch up and secure the victory here. Okay, he just went with electro giant in the back. I'm not sure about that play, guys. Boomer as well. Let's go with a fireball. I knew that he was going to have to blow mother wage and I think we just won to be honest. Skeletons are locking onto the tower. 90 HP. Last skeleton with a dream with the gold to take the tower. Beautiful game right there. Plus 26 medals. Unfortunately, not a perfect video, but still really fun video. Had a lot of fun playing with the top three best decks in the world right now from the best players. Riley ranked number three. Eay ranked number two with this deck. And I think the recruits player, I don't even know his name. It was Lagusa rank number one with his recruit. Unfortunate loss against Henry, but still amazing video. Hopefully you guys enjoyed it. If you did, please make sure to smack the like button. If you're not subscribed to the channel yet, feel free to subscribe. And I will see you guys in one of my next videos. sticking us."

    "title": "BEST DECK for DISTURBED GRAVES CHALLENGE!",
    "creator": "SirTagCR - Clash Royale",
    "transcript": "Hey, what's up guys? We're back again to showcase the best deck for the Disturbed Graves challenge in Clash Royale. This new challenge is going to have two tombstones. One big tombstone, one small tombstone. The small tombstone spawns skeletons. When it dies, it poops out a royal ghost. The big tombstone poops out guards and then when it dies, it drops a big giant skeleton king. So, that's what you're going to have to keep in mind. Basically, this challenge is all about spawning troops. A lot of people are going to be playing bowlers, mother witches, executioners, cards that are great into situations where they can stockpile a lot of counter pushing cards or just bounce back and incinerate fake cards that are going in. So, uh, earthquake is really good because it allows you to disturb the graveyard, the graves basically of the tombstones, killing them. Fuller is phenomenal because it bounces through everything. It can kill an entire stocked up lane from the opponent. Inferno Dragon's great because it wins bridge battles and it's just overall fantastic against people that are trying to use executioners and bowlers because they're just going to die. And then you have the knight and the Valkyrie because guess what? If your opponent is going to be using a Royal Ghost, you're going to have an awesome option to counter the Royal Ghost whether it's a king activation with NATO or the Knight or Valkyrie to stop it. Ices are just very slow. It's a very cost effective three elixir card. And then, you know, Earthquake again for the uh the buildings that are stockpiled. Hog Rider is an afterthought. There are going to be two different decks that I showcase. This is not my deck. This is Smurf Blades deck. He specifically said Hog Rider, you just drop it whenever you defend, you get a bit of elixir advantage and you counter push and drop the Hog Rider like in double elixir maybe or at very infrequent intervals where you're up a ton and you're just trying to win the game faster cuz these games take forever if you don't play them correctly. And that's kind of annoying. This is my deck. This one's Graveyard. It's pretty much the same thing. You're going to be going in for bowlers, executioners, uh trying to win bridge battles, maybe with mother witch, so you get a lot of stockpiling stuff. Arrows because people run firecracker, tornado, just because you want to clump things up. Graveyard and poison are more of an afterthought. They're really only double elixir cards. You can't really drop them in single unless your opponent sucks and messes up. So basically, this challenge, I'm just going to say straight up, it is going to take a while. It is not that fun, but you'll win if you use either of these decks. Let's get right into the swing of things and show you guys what's up. Uh yeah, there's a mode at the end, so it is definitely worth playing in my book. So the first deck that we'll play, I think we'll use the Hog Rider deck because I covered that first. I think the graveyard deck is the one that I'm most comfortable with. If you look at my battle log, I played pretty much both of them here. So yeah, this was like a different thing, but ever since I started playing like 2 hours ago, I practiced a few of them. I was like, \"Okay, I won every single game with it. The decks are pretty good, and I was playing against ultimate champion players.\" So let's get into it. Uh yeah, if you guys enjoy this type of content, definitely leave a like. I try to come up with the best possible decks for the challenge. Break them down so everyone can understand. And by the way, three earthquakes is what kills a big tombstone. You don't really have to be too careful about killing the regular tombstone. It doesn't necessarily matter that much. Oh, if we could activate King Tower, that would be huge, but I think I'm going to try to do that. I haven't done this before, but I do think if I go like inside. Okay, never mind. It's spawned guards. Um, I was kind of hoping that we'd be able to do that. But I guess if the tombstone is spawning stuff directly into their royal ghost that spawns, you're not able to do it. But if the uh royal ghost is going on the other side, it would have been easier for us to do that. Yeah, as I said before, it's not really about cycling hog riders. It's more so about winning bridge battles. And then the inferno dragon allows us to do that cuz we are able to kill bowlers. Like his bowler loses and then because his bowler loses, then he doesn't do a great job into this. So just overall great interactions for us. The inferno dragon will eventually die, but still like he's taking damage to the other side. Earthquake on the big tombstone is nice because if you guys didn't know, um the tombstone does take three earthquakes to kill. I don't know if I said that before, but it is pretty important to realize that you don't have to earthquake every single regular tombstone. You can earthquake every other regular tombstone, but the main to tombstone that you want to kill is the first one. Um, and the evolved witch isn't actually that good. So, we don't really have to worry about it there. With the Valkyrie and other stuff, we should be fine. So, um, that's one of the main reasons that you should be playing Valkyrie so you don't get cooked by this witch. Um, it's just not going to do great into bowlers. It's not going to do great into that stuff. So, guards are going to be a little bit annoying. Goblin curse is mid. So, I wouldn't play that. Uh, we're going to win the bridge battle. As you can see, this this game mode takes forever. It actually takes forever. We're going to win because he's going to not kill our tombstone. We're going to kill his tombstone, and then he's going to get a bit of a disadvantage. So, as I said before, three tombstone uh earthquakes is what you want. Three earthquakes kills the tombstone. And I earthquake on the other tombstone. The earthquake um is really important because if you're noticing, the tombstone doesn't lose health. So, the tombstone doesn't lose health. Therefore, it's difficult for the opponent to um ever like, you know, kill our tombstone. And we're just going to spawn guards. The guards helped us out there. Take the tower. Like, this guy's cooked. There's nothing he can do. He just got outplayed. He didn't really understand the challenge that well. He um wasn't trying to kill our tombstone. Notice how he's not getting a big tombstone. Bro doesn't have a big tombstone. I have a big tombstone. Bro's cooked. So, it's it's just that simple. I get the earthquake on the tombstone. I get three of them. Then, I win that interaction because three earthquakes kills the tombstone. Then after that, the opponent is sitting there wondering how he's supposed to kill guards that I'm spawning for free. Getting a free guard spawner is essentially three elixir for free every single time. You might not think that's a lot, but it is. It is quite a bit. And I I hadn't really went in for my hog riders very often. It's not like a hog cycle deck. You are a if you cycle your wink edition and you think that's a good thing. I think that any person in the comment section that says that these decks are bad, um, they might not be like, you know, the absolute best deck for you. Maybe you're comfortable with something else, but you should easily be able to win these challenges with either of these decks and some people are going to cycle their hog rider or the bridge and they're going to lose the game and then they're going to go to the comment section. They're going to be like, \"These decks suck.\" So, you just just going to let you guys know I I'm predicting the future. That is exactly what's going to happen. And they're not even going to like watch the uh commentary or anything. They're just going to say, \"These decks are bad.\" But in reality, they're just dropping hog rutters at the bridge or graveyards for no reason. So, uh, yeah, we'll play this deck as well, just to show you guys an overview, and then, you know, we're probably not going to lose any games. Uh, that's what my that's what my goal is today. I dislike this event, says Caleb. Hey, I'm right there with you, man. I actually don't like this event either. Uh, I am a big proponent of telling you guys if I like events or if I don't. This was not one of my favorites. Um, I I genuinely liked a lot of the other events a lot more. This one's too slow paced for my liking. Um, I want more fast-paced games. I want more fast-paced action. Um, as you can see, unfortunately, this guy got a good interaction there. We're going to go Mother Witch on the left side, and I'm definitely going to go arrows on the firecracker cuz, as I said, like this deck is going to be pretty successful in a lot more situations, uh, if your opponent has firecracker cuz you do have arrows for it. Um, I did build this one. I put in graveyard. I think that if you don't have a wink condition whatsoever, you're kind of cooked the later the game gets. So, I don't really want to get to late part of the game and then not have a wink edition. I also think Valkyrie is like an unbelievable necessity. All right, we're going to activate king tower here. Hopefully with tornado a I'm bad. One more tile lower. That's okay. Well, that's h that's fine. I I've done it before. I didn't do it there. One more tile lower right here would have been fine. Just like pulling it a little bit better. Would have been cool. So, we're going to go bowler. Unfortunately, we are getting cooked a little bit. I have to go poison on this. H. It's not great cuz uh the firecracker moved out of the way. This is not looking the way that we wanted at all at all, my dudes. But hear me out. We were probably going to arrows the firecracker anyway. a second time because we were going to try to damage down this uh this tombstone. I have to kill this tombstone if I have a good shot of winning this game. As you guys can see right now, I'm at a very big disadvantage. Um, looking at where we are, we don't have the tombstone. The big tombstone matters. He's going to get graveyard. Uh, sorry, he's going to get guards for free for the rest of the game if I don't kill it. This is very, very, very, very bad. This is red alert, actually. Even though I'm currently winning the game, I would say I'm still in a bad spot. So, uh, I totally need to readjust and find my footing because I did not play this super well. We're going to go for an executioner here, and we should be able to activate King Tower, and that's going to be nice. Um, then we can go in for a bowler in the other side. Unfortunately, because our cards are so freaking cost effective overall, things will end up being okay. Uh, but for the majority of people, like, you probably don't want to play this way. You probably don't want to like have to drop Mother Witch and be forced to drop extra Elixir for no reason. It's just like not a fun interaction ever. So, I'm going to go in for that. Uh the evo zap is kind of mid. Uh he's going to earthquake as well and just not get that much value. We're going to poison here and uh with the piggy defending, we should be good in the other side. I don't think that he's going to be able to spam much else into that for a little bit. You don't really want to drop things directly into a uh unit there. Wouldn't make that much sense cuz then we get more time to do whatever the heck we want. Yeah, the cost effectiveness of this deck is what really lets it thrive. I'm not going to sugarcoat it. It's not like as like reliable as having an earthquake, but here's the thing. like if your opponent earthquakes you out, you can still probably win because the cost effectiveness of the uh bowler is just really really high. Even though he's getting free guards, it is going into a bowler and an executioner. So, it's not like the best. You have wink edition that gets directly on the tower. So, that's always nice. Um I quite like that. So, those are just things that I would keep in mind. Like, if I have a wink condition that can immediately walk on the tower, I I really really like that. And then obviously if he uh firecrackers, we're just going to get arrows every single time. And then the buller just cleans this all up. So, I'm going to Valk just in case cuz sometimes skeletons sprawl in your tower for no reason. And then we're going to get fireballed, which doesn't matter. We're going to go in for this. And then he could go in for a firecracker, which I would assume he kind of has to. We have the royal ghost counter pushing. Not really going to matter. We're just going to poison, get our graveyard skeleton damage, and win the game. So, as you can see, even though I am matching into an earthquake deck, because I have graveyard, and I have really cost effective cards. That means that it doesn't matter as much if he kills the tombstone, but it is still annoying at the highest level of gameplay. I do think earthquake earthquake cycle decks are probably slightly better, but I I just want to highlight something again. I was not a I did not cycle graveyards on the tower until I realized that I could. You do not do that in single elixir. If you are bad at the game, you can do that and you will lose a lot of matches. But hopefully you guys do not do that. Um, do not cycle graveyards on the tower. Do not go for hog riders. It is an afterthought of going in for wing edition. That is the best way that I could explain it. So, we're going to go bowler here directly behind the tower. And you guys might be like, \"Oh my gosh, you don't have a Goblin Barrel counter.\" You guys just saw You can use Valkyrie, you can use Bowler, you can use tornado. There's a lot of awesome options in this deck. Ro predicted the future. No, dude. I've just done these challen I do these challenges every single day uh that they come out. Like, so whenever there's a challenge, you guys can always come to my channel and find a good deck with reliable advice that you guys can win games with. Also, I did that because he misplaced the Tesla and he wasted four elixir. So, I just wanted to be 100% clear of why I went for the hog rudder because a lot of people will be like, \"Why are you doing that? I'm just trying to win the games as fast as I can and I wanted to flex on this guy cuz he made a really bad play going for a Tesla. Doesn't doesn't counter push. So, usually I wouldn't do that, but in this very specific situation, like I felt comfortable doing it. Like, bro cycled the dark goblin into a bowler. Like, this is not a real game. Um, I'm just going to go in for Earthquakes here and win the game. So, uh yeah, his his tombstone is already pretty much dead. We can start to do split lane pressure as well at higher levels of gameplay. Having the knight is really nice. So, shout out again to Smurf Blade for creating this. Um, I think my deck works really well as you guys saw in the last game. But my deck also takes a lot a little bit longer of a time period if I am playing against a worse player. The good thing is I can disrespectfully go in for a hog rider and win the match. But this is not something that you want to do if you are worse at the game or if you can identify like when you can just straight up win because your opponent's like playing poorly. So I I just want to be 100% clear when I do this. When I go for a hog rider, it is disrespectful. It is bad to do to your opponent unless they just play poorly. how it is, you know, sometimes it be that way. Bros cycling dark goblins into bull is like, you know, like nobody's business. It happens. Let's go. What do you think about the current state of Goblin Stein? I think Goblin Stein's kind of like a mid card right now. It's not phenomenal. It's not bad, but like it's not great compared to other champions. I must almost always rather like run a skeleton king or a boss bandit or an archer queen or I don't know, man. I just I personally don't really vibe with the uh Goblin Stein that much. I I don't find myself getting too much value with it. I've seen people play Hog Rider decks with it. I've seen people play a lot of different decks with it. And I'm just like, well, if you're playing Hog Rider deck, I'd rather have Evo Valkyrie, which is broken. It's just unfair card. It's the biggest bailout defensive card in the game right now. Or hypothetically, like, you know, just play like other better champions. Like, it's wasting a slot in my eyes in a lot of situations. So, um yeah, I don't know. I'm not a huge fan of it. It's not one of my favorite cards and uh personally probably wouldn't play it in most decks. So, I'm gonna go in for that. And I'm also not really a fan of Evolve Snowball, though. So, like there are certain things that I'm personally not a fan of. And the card is like objectively good. Uh I I know for a fact like Snowball is one of the best cards in the game, Evolve Snowball. Especially pairing it with a Goblin uh drill and then you pull the opponent's units off of the drill and lock onto their tower and then the game's just over. So, how it is. Good deck. Just tried it. Yeah, I mean both the decks that I'm showing are phenomenal. How do you feel? Uh there's always noobs who have to blame skill issues and blame the deck if they lose. Yeah, I mean to be fair, if you're playing real Clash Royale matches and you push up this high as you possibly can, you will start to lose because of your deck. That is 100% something that does happen. But if you are playing these challenges against casual players that have bad decks, you are losing the game because you are playing poorly. That is just how it is. Could someone write or pin the deck? I mean, you can just like look at the eight cards in the deck. Um or like uh go backward and then take a look that way. Can we spawn guards? Maybe not. Oops, I misclicked. No, I didn't. Oh, I hit it. Beautiful. All right, so that's the timing. That's what you guys want to do. So, if you do that, you can activate King Tower and then if you play against a graveyard deck, the graveyard deck loses. Again, here's here's here's how the challenge works. The tombstone when it dies, it spawns a royal ghost. When the big tombstone dies, it spawns a um it spawns a skeleton king. You want to kill your opponent's tombstone as fast as possible. Three earthquakes is what kills it. Do not drop hog riders. Just chill. Relax a little bit, bro. And just win the game. The firecracker is a bit obnoxious. I'm not going to fit. The firecracker freaking sucks for me to play into. But hear me out. Bowler bully boy. Look at that. Look at that. That bowler placement though, guys. I am so locked today. By the way, I'm going to Vegas. I feel like I've never gambled in my life. I probably really won't. Um, but I'm gonna watch my friend gamble and maybe I'll give him some good luck. I'm going to the front row Card Show for Pokemon and I'm going to be filming a lot of content. Um, some of my really rich friends are going to go there with me and I think we're going to do some fun videos. So, um, I'm excited for that. I'm really excited cuz it's going to be like an experience that I've never had before in my life. So, I I like can't tell you guys how excited I am right now because I haven't had this level of excitement in Saudi Arabia when I got blessed to go to that type of trip and I was just I don't know. I some random things happened in my life that I feel like I don't deserve that happen. I'm just like, dude, I'm I I don't know. I the words can't describe how excited I am. So, hopefully you guys will be able to see that in content. And um I'm really really hyped to release the best videos I can. I have my entire editor team like ready to create content for me when I um when I film it and I'm going to be shipping it out as soon as I can on my second channel. If you guys haven't already subscribed there, it's Stir Shadow Tag. I do Pokemon content. Going to be a lot of IRL Pokemon content coming up soon. Anyway, that's just a shameless shout out if you guys want to follow me there. And no worries if you don't. It's Pokemon stuff and real life stuff. So maybe you're just here for the Clash Royale. But yeah, also I do these type of challenges every single freaking time that there's a there's a challenge. There will always be something on my channel. So if you want to subscribe for that, you know, subscribe and stay connected because you will not want to miss out on the best decks for these challenges cuz you'll win challenges so much easier with my decks. Anyway, we can just use Bolar Ice Wizard infer Dragon. Everything dies. I really do like Smurf Blades deck unless you're playing against firecracker. Like that's it. I mean, firecracker you can tornado, but yeah, it's just like not a fun card to play against. As you can see, we're spawning a lot more stuff than him. And again, uh Smurf Blades tip for this was when you're using Earthquake, you only worry about every other tombstone, not the the tombstone that spawns. Like, if there's a tombstone that spawns, you only have to worry about every other one, not every single one. So, skip one, worry about that one. Skip one, worry about that one. Skip one, worry about that one. So, it is what it is. Again, I do think that the tornado here is going to be cool so that we can hopefully kill the uh firecracker. It was just doing too much damage. And the other cool thing is like the split lane pressure, the knight skeletons, the knight tanking for skeletons is awesome. I don't think Smurf Blade told me about that or talked about that to me, but um yeah, truthfully, like uh the knight tanking for skeletons is really sick. Also, Evo Valkyrie is such a bailout. Look at this. It's going to pull the uh freaking skeleton barrel and then it's just such a good card. It's really really goatated. though. He still hasn't killed my tombstone. I'm still spawning guards. He doesn't understand the challenge whatsoever. And that's why, you know, if you come to my channel, if you watch these videos, you'll know what the freaking cards do without having to spend your own time experimenting with it. I'll let you guys know how the challenge operates. How, you know, guards spawn out of the big tombstone and it takes three earthquakes to kill it. And, you know, if you know that, then you're going to focus on three earthquakes and not stupidly spam into the tombstone where you're getting your opponent free value because they're spawning guards. The best starting hand is using earthquake and then activating king tower as you guys saw with the uh with the royal ghost. So I think I can do that again. I hope. We'll see. We'll see if guards spawn and screw me over. But I think we can do it again. Yeah, it's pretty it's pretty reliable. Like just keep doing that exact placement, that exact timing. You activate king tower graveyard becomes useless. You can force them to go for the royal ghost by using the earthquake on the tombstone. And I here here's the thing. If if you're not good enough to do that, that's totally fine. You don't have to like memorize that tornado placement. You don't have to earthquake on the tombstone to force the royal ghost and activate king tower. But if you do do that, it's just an extra layer of dominance that you can dish out. Uh that's just, you know, that's what we like to say out here. So, I'm going to try to go in for like a knight here and then see what else we can do. Maybe we can just maybe throw down a hog rider. We've already activated king tower. We did take a lot more damage than I would want, but this hog rider seems okay since he doesn't have anything to block it. And uh I think he just loses the game, though. I wouldn't reliably do this, but I'm just being disrespectful right now. So, want to get these challenges done as fast as I can. Uh I paid 500k and got the emote. I mean, you can do that, too. That's fine for you, bro. Uh you're you're getting the emote, but I think you might miss out on some of the other stuff, right? Uh, it's gold mostly, so that doesn't matter. But I think there's like a banner, unless it gives you the banner and the emote. Not sure if it does that. Why stream now and not at 2 a.m.? Because I'm going to Las Vegas, so I had a lot of stuff to do last night. I was actually packing and planning for my trip and um doing a lot of stuff last minute, unfortunately. But uh yeah. Yeah, it was not a trip that was supposed to happen in this fashion. It was supposed to be um a little bit more calculated. And then, you know, a lot of my friends came along and that's a good thing, honestly. But it made it a little bit more hectic, so I didn't have as much time to uh, you know, stay up and then do the stream. I wanted to make sure that when I do these videos that it's extremely calculated and that I know all the interactions and that I have like good decks to showcase for you guys. Um, both the decks that, you know, we're playing today are great options to play. And if you like go on my stream, I want to make sure that I can give you a great synopsis of like what to do. Um, a lot of people would appreciate that more than a rush stream, me winning at 2:00 a.m. uh when I don't have the time to like go through the challenge. Usually I do have the time to go through the challenge, but I specifically very infrequently like today will not and then I'll have to postpone it till the morning. So, you know, it is what it is. But yeah, this is the very first time that I've had to do that in I think over three or four months, which which happens, but I I don't travel too often, so got to do that sometimes. Pokemon related. Yes, sir. Gold is uh negligible. You have to play the challenge for the banner specifically. The gold is neg Yeah. Yeah, that makes sense. Let's go. Let's go. Regarding firecracker, there will have always been times in late game where I'd have to spend EQ plus NATO six elixir, but it gets the job done. Yeah, that makes sense. All right, so we can play one more game with this deck. I kind of like the Hog Rider one because I can win the game a little bit more reliably against noobs. This I can't. This is like more of a guaranteed win if you are worse at the game. I think this this uh graveyard deck is pretty pretty reliable if you're bad at the game and you just want to cycle stuff because the bullyer and the executioner are pretty big bailouts. They allow you to defend against almost everything. Also, a lot of times people have poison. They'll poison on top of the tombstone. You're like, \"Well, you can't do that in late game, bro. Either my mother witch or my graveyard is going to cook you.\" He'll probably graveyard here probably. Or not graveyard. He'll probably uh Yeah, I'm not going to graveyard. I thought he would like um go bowler. My bad. That was what I would assume. He didn't do it though. All right, there's the bully boy. I'm just going to poison on the bowler actually. And I could tornado. So then the executioner would hit the uh Duff. I think that would be a good decision. I don't think that would be a bad place. The only downside of this deck, the main thing that I've realized is when I don't have my bowler, it really sucks. It's just such a bad feeling. So, just keep that in mind as like I really wish I would always have the bowler, but you don't always get what you want in life, you know. All right, we're going to do this. Cycle our buller at the bridge. Got to make sure that when the tombstone dies, it doesn't really respawn. At least from my understanding. I don't think the big tombstone respawns. I've never seen it respawn. Uh, so that's cool. The small tombstone respawns all the time. So, you're trying to get as much damage as you can on the big tombstone. The mother witch piggy is putting in work as well. Just like wins that interaction a little bit harder. So, there's two ways of killing the tombstone. It's like brute forcing your way through with cards that are strong or using like earthquake and getting damage on it that way. So, uh both are decent options, but you know, pick whichever way you like. Um this one's more of a brute force mechanism of winning bridge battles and then dominating the opponent because they don't get the free guards. But yeah, he gets a skeleton king, but that's all that's all he's going to get for the rest of the game. No more skeleton kings. We can executioner here. It's going to kill that and that's also going to go side that we want. So, I like that. quite like that a lot. So, we're currently winning the game, I would say, based off of like how these interactions have been going. I also think I can go in for a pretty juicy bowler here. And then we're going to get good counter push. We're going to have guards spawn on the right side behind this as well. He's definitely in a tough spot because I can executioner counter his with my uh tornado. And hopefully we're able to just hit the tower for a lot of damage and maybe even win the game. Hopefully, that didn't really happen, but it was still pretty good. We can mother witch at the bridge here because the skeletons are not getting killed somehow. And then we'll just evo Valkyrie on this. I really like the uh golem machine. It's probably one of my favorite cards or actually I I said it was my favorite card in the game. I think it is right now. Even more so the magic archer based off of like how fun it is to play. It is a really really fun card to use play just like getting wins with. It's it there's not much that can even come close to that uh type of happiness for me playing with that card. All right. So yeah, he's probably going to kill this soon. Going to throw down arrows here on the firecracker. It can't really scoot that much further back, so we should kill it. And then uh yeah, we can just throw down more stuff here. We got the rogos to left side. We still get our guards because he hasn't even killed it yet. We tornadoes back if we wanted. Doesn't really matter. We're just going to win this game a little bit slower because again, we are running the graveyard version. So it's uh just, you know, that's how it is. It'd be that way. Use executioner on defense if things get close because you can push back the hog rider. It's like not that big of a deal. And I'm going to arrows here. We did play that pretty well. Firecracker's out of cycle, so that's fine. We could mother witch here. Or we could just spam more stuff in the right side. I think we just spam more stuff in the right side. To be honest, save our NATO. Most likely kind of have to save our NATO. I'm going to graveyard here. This probably wins game. I don't see him defending against the bowler and then the Valkyrie and then, you know, me poisoning here. The bowler hits tower and the game's definitely over. So, GG. Good guy, good player. He's not a bad player, but as you guys can see, pretty easy victory. So, good looks. Uh, I I I would say like whatever one floats your boat, you're not going to get your ship synced by either of the decks. I kind of like the banners. I mean, you could, as much as you want, go and spend the 500k and get it. It's just not for me, man. I I'm not a huge fan of like buying my way through the emote shop. like spending that 500k, you're eventually not going to be able to do that, you know? Like it's not something that you're going to be able to do every single time because even if you have max gold, I bet you they're going to have other ways of draining your gold bank. Like think of it from the perspective of like they might have another million gold tower skin. Do you want to just keep using all of your gold to like get the emotes from the challenges or would you rather use it on some exclusive tower skin, right, that will eventually come out? Also, those arrows were awful. I should have hit the tombstone, the big tombstone. fine though. It's all just scam. I don't think it's a scam. It's an option. It's like if someone presents you a bad option, you just don't take the bad option, you know? That's fine. And that's okay. I don't think it's really scammy or anything. I think honestly I would prefer to have them have more options in the game and that's okay if they're bad. Poison's kind of mid. I should have probably hit the left tombstone, but it's fine. We don't get to hit anything here really. So, we should be able to activate King Tower again. And then we're just gonna do this. Nice. Yeah, as you guys can see, like it's so cool to know that placement against Royal Ghost because you're not going to pull it to the tombstone. The issue is I would typically pull it more so oriented in the middle, but if you pull it more oriented in the middle and you pull it like here, then it's going to go towards this big tombstone and this is going to damage your big tombstone. So, you have to like pull it off in the side to activate King Tower. Let's go. Let's go. Yeah, there's a difference between a scam and a ripoff. I agree. So, like a ripoff is something that it's a deal and it's not something that you should be really taking. A scam is advertised as something that is like supposed to be really good and then in reality they don't promise. They don't deliver on their promise. At least that's what I assume like scam and ripoff would be. Ah, you guys can tell me if it's different. How's your day going? It's going great, man. I'm super hyped for Vegas. That's going to be in a couple hours. I'm literally leaving in like three hours, guys. I'm so hyped. All right, so we're going to go for a Valkyrie. Wait, it's less than 3 hours. Oh my gosh. How am I going to I have to record video like two videos. 3 hours, guys. And pack a little bit more. Oh man, this is going to be an adventure, isn't it? All right, we're going to tornado this back and then arrows. That was beautiful because you just get to spawn tombstones whenever you want. All right, he's going to earthquake there. That's fine. The poison here. Hit the tombstone. That's a little bit annoying. But I think this guy's running the deck that's good. I think he's running uh you know the hog rider earthquake cycle decks that everyone's playing. They're just strong decks in general. So, you know, like that's kind of what we have to expect that people will be playing the better decks in Clash Royale. Like that's what I would anticipate people to do cuz that's what I would do. You know, I would try to play the best decks in the game. He's still going to get smacked because my deck is better. My deck is the best. Not really. I mean, the the decks that we showed, the the two that I've seen are the best two that I've seen so far out of every deck. Still haven't lost with it. It's like not even been that close. We're tornado here. Poison here. Should kill all that. Yep. Fog Rider's dead. No damage. Oh, we should have mother witched on that. That would have been a nice little piggy. A Valk here. Can probably go for like a bowler in a graveyard cuz he's going to be down a little bit. So, honestly, I'll just do it. Not really like an advisable thing, but again, if you're up a lot, it doesn't really matter all that much. And we can get Jiggy with the piggy and get three of them. Hopefully, two of them is fine, too. Or I guess a lot more than two. That's fine. We'll get a lot more than two. That's chill. Oh, man. And he's not even able to kill. We getting Valkyrie here. Keep him off of our mother witch. Get off my lawn. All right, he's going to lose this battle at the bridge 100%. I don't even think I care if it's a hit. Doesn't matter that much to me cuz then we can just go through with the graveyard again and then throw down another poison. As you guys can see, like it's a way more um arduous battle when you're playing our deck, but it it does deliver the promise of the piggy. The promise of the piggy will always give you the hit. All right, we're just going to NATO and poison and arrows and win the game. So, pretty free victory. We'll go to the next one. They don't need uh they they don't understand they need to EQ cycle on the big tombstone. You don't need to EQ cycle. You could run poison as well and just run like a super omega ultra defensive deck and then use graveyard last seconds to win. So, that's what I like that's my game plan. If I wanted to win every game, I think that's what I would probably do. But yeah, EQ with bowler is really good, too. You see the donut from earlier? I did not see the donut from earlier. Thank you for letting me know. Edits, thank you for the the $1.90. Hopefully you're having a great day. Appreciate the support, man. Foggy Q Firecracker is the best according to Roy API. Well, Royal API is not the best way to look at these challenges. The best way to look at these challenges, talk to a top 10,000 player or higher like Smurf Blade, who's better than me, and look at the decks that we come up with and not use stats from casual players that don't know the game as well. Honestly, that's just that's just the reality of it. Um, not going to lie. That's just how it be, man. That's how it be. Royal API is an okay tool, but it's definitely not the best tool. All right. At least for these challenges because it takes an aggregate stats from like what everyone's playing and people play follow the leader. So, often times when people play follow the leader, they'll just play decks that were already okay. And there's some challenges. I looked at API things and the decks were actually awful. They weren't even good options. They were like objectively like the worst option you could do. I think like people were running um like super bad cycle decks and a challenge where you needed to what was it? I I think it was like the touchdown challenge where the recruits uh were everywhere and you had to like fireball arrows and kill the um the towers so then they would stop spawning stuff and no one understood that and they were just running awful decks. I I don't know. Sometimes Roy API just misses really hard. It's not their fault. It's just casual players that they base the stats off of are not people that you want to be taking um you not want to be taking advice from. All right, we're going to go for a Valk here with the ice. Kind of bad for us, honestly. It's going to be a bunch of damage. Um I don't really like how much damage he's getting here. The executioner is going to hit my tower, too. Oh, wait, never mind. We're chilling. I thought it was going to be way worse for us than it was. This hog rider seems bad. I'm just going to go bull in the back. You shouldn't be going hog very often if you're played like actually well. Usually you just use the knight on the rogue ghost when it spawns and then you know cycle bowlers and win bridge battles and then if they cycle stuff like bowlers use inferno dragon to win the bridge battle trying to like meander our way through towards another earthquake. So that's what we're going to be doing here. You don't have to go hog rider earthquake. I think I've been doing that too much. Going to win the bridge battle here with infer dragon. Again conditions are straight up afterthoughts. They're not really things that you want to be cycling as much. Cannon's interesting. I think this guy is literally just running like a deck that he's played a lot and not really running something that's smart. I'm going to hog rider here cuz we have a lot of counter pushing stuff. And then we also have a two evolutions. This just makes sense logically for us to do this. Logistically, I think he's just going to lose the game. There's no shot in hell that he's defending us. He has nothing. Dude's cooked. We're going to earthquake here. We're going to probably take most of his tower on the other side. Really? Did we not get back to what we wanted at all? Did he just play extremely well? Did I get outplayed? Hopefully not. I don't know. Doesn't look great. I guess I misplayed that. It's fine, though. Could have pulled that to the king tower without taking any damage. This guy's played really well. Wait, I could actually lose. I'm surprised. Let's Let's focus up. Let's focus up. Ro played better than me for sure. All right, so we still have matchup advantage, so I think I win, but he played better than me. That's kind of embarrassing. We probably need to start going for more stuff like Valkyries and Natos. And then we should be able to kill everything there. So, I'm going to win bridge battles. I need to get a hog rider through a cannon. I don't know if I can do that. I probably also need to go knight. And he's going to start going deliveries on this. He's played better than me. He's actually just played better than me. I think I win based off match up though. It' be really hard for him to fully defend this. Okay, so he goes to cannon in a spot that still gets earthquake. He gets a bad trade here, I think, cuz we're able to tornado everything. And we're just going to cycle more bowlers and then Valkyrie with it. There's no way bowler Valkyrie like lets any damage happen, right? Oh, it got a hit. Damn, that's crazy. Wait, do I actually lose to someone like this? Oh my gosh. All right, we got to do this. Go other side. This would be such a sad loss cuz this guy just played better than me by a lot then. Damn, what a good player. I thought for sure I won. Let's see. Okay, I would have focused a lot more. I didn't know that this guy was this good. He's just better than me at the game. I don't know what his rank is, but he's very, very good. I'm super surprised. I don't know who the heck this is. He's just played this way better than I thought. Definitely an ultimate champion player. I just don't know what skill level. Oh, wait. I hit the tower. Wait, wait, wait. I'm still going to lose unless Oh, the hog rider dies. Damn, dude. Just really well played. I don't know who this was. I'm going to take a look. Bro was cooking. Yeah, he played phenomenal. Sometimes I don't touch the electro dragon is rough for this deck if they're a lot. Yeah, but people aren't going to play electro dragon and you can just kill it with executioner, right? We not have executioner in this deck or is that the other deck? That's the other deck. Okay. Yeah, in first dragon would be rough. You have to do dual lane pressure for sure and then just use ice wizard on defense and not stack up too much stuff. Who the heck was that? Play that really well. Probably a mini account. A lot of times people play on mini accounts cuz that's what they do. That dude was definitely not that level. He was uh definitely better than that. That's crazy. Yeah, sometimes I go on my mini accounts and I just try to get the rewards on all my accounts. It'd be really funny if it was like a pro Pedro player. Not the uh Pedro X or whatever, but there's like a lot of uh Hispanic like really good players that are named Pedro that like I always see like a a new one pop up. Like for instance, uh I don't know if you guys know Diego B. There's like a Diego G and a Diego like I I don't know, Diego D. And I'm just like dude, why are there so many, bro? Why why are there so many pro Dieos? Is there something in the water, bro? Like, why are you guys so good? It's hilarious. Okay, this guy is messed up. That's uh he just pulled the hog rider on the tombstone. That's crazy. There's a Diego E. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. There is a Diego E, too. And I try to be honest, if my opponent's just straight up better than me, like, I'll just say it, you know? Bro was really good at the game. I was not ready for someone that played that well. I mean, to be honest, I should have won the game if I was more focused. But I wouldn't have won because I'm better than him. I would have won because my deck is better than his in that matchup. So, yeah, my skill issue there for sure. Screw us. It's fine. We're not going to lose the game for the rest of the challenge, though. It's fine. There's like 10 US Ricks, but I think that's a meme. I think everyone's like creating a US Rick account cuz it's like a funny thing to do. You know, you talk too much this game. Yeah, I think I yapped a little bit too much last game, too. I I mean, to be honest, like I'm streaming, not going to not talk, you know? But yeah. Yeah, that's definitely a a very good reason for me to take the L. Favorite card of all time is probably Magic Archer, but it's not really usable right now, which kind of sucks. Okay, so this bowler isn't that big of a problem. I can just Valk on it and then just use Bowler other side. This is a free win. I've already won. He didn't even He didn't do anything to do the tombstone. The big tombstone's big. Big tombstone is big. The uh Evo Exylade girth is so ridiculous. You just said a sentence I never thought someone would unironically say. Can we Can we not say that again, bro? I'm uncomfortable. What did I just witness? Oh man. All right. All right, dude. Sure. Sure. All right. Dropping a hog rider. That sucked. That was not great. Good gameplay from our opponents, but it's fine. If you like overcommit, you kind of just get destroyed by the counter push from your opponent. Try not to do that. Like hog rider there was just mid on my end. I was surmitting there, guys. That's what I was. Oh my gosh, the fact that that bowler just hit is insane. Bowler slaps. Yeah, I'm just going to Valky the mother witch. If the Valkyrie just goes towards the mother witch. Damn, Valk. I see how it is. All right, so he loses bowler. Bye bye American Pie. All right. Yeah. No, he's cooked now. I think I mean I said it last time I lost. So we'll see. We'll see if I'm going to get cooked, guys. I might suck. Imagine losing with matchup advantage. Couldn't be me for the second game in a row. Be so sad. Oh, this is so good for us cuz I I mean I honestly I don't think he played very well at the start. This infern dragon's mid. I don't know what that was doing, but here I guess on the other side maybe. No, I think bowler is better probably into the uh spam that he's going to do cuz it's like long range. Uh the the executioner is does a lot more damage close range. So that's bad for me. I still have to do it. I don't really have any other options. So is what it is. All right, we got a lot of stuff there. The bowler's going to die. It's totally fine. He's going to have to go in for probably a tombstone and then maybe a building. I don't know. The tombstone's like pretty lucky that that worked for him. Pop the skeleton king ability. I like the fact that the skeleton king at least allows you to have a bit more mobility. Otherwise, these like things you just wouldn't be able to win games, you know? Oh my goodness, dude. Thank god the tombstone spawned in the wrong spot. Oh, he missed. Thank god. This was just taking forever, man. This would have been like a long battle where no one accomplishes anything for forever. The bowler hitting the tower a couple times is good though. The Inferno Dragon doesn't win there cuz the push back. Still fine. Fog here. So, we force extra elixir. Ice wizard here. And then like not having a win condition in general is kind of like bad for this challenge. At higher levels of gameplay in the later stages of the game, people will have too much elixir and you'll just lose. Also, he just lost to the bowler. So, bully bully is elite. That was elite Lee. Elite bully bully elite. You taste defeat. Goodbye. That was pretty good. Uh Mr. V is not undefeated even though his clan says that. Aug missing his hammer plushy. Yes, sir. You guys don't you don't have to delete what Benjamin said there. It's fine. If they want to meme around, it's fine. You don't have to delete anything like that. Um it's all good. It's all good. I just won't read it out loud, you know. The only thing I think we'll ever delete is like if someone's like, you know, mean to someone else in a really derogatory way. It's fine if they mess around and meme and they say like, you know, little bit sus stuff. It's fine. always mods always leave those alone. It's cool. As long as they're not like, you know, drawing uh you know, different uh body parts all over the chat, then then we're okay. You know, that's the only sus thing that we don't allow here. Like if you're actually using those images. Okay. Um this is fine. I think I just Valk on the left. The guy hog riding is insane. Like he gets nothing from that. It's just four elixir wasted. People do that though. They they do be wasting their elixir. it'll be Karen. So, generally what I like to do is I I just defend with cards and then I earthquake the tombstones. That's all you want to do. If you drop wind conditions, you're just feeding your opponent elixir cuz they have two defensive buildings for free and the tombstone's free. The tombstone just keeps spawning for like endlessly. He was spamming. Yeah. Yeah. No, it's fine. Yeah. Yeah. I I guess cuz he was spamming. That makes sense. If he just spams the same message a million times, it's okay, I guess. Delete it. How can you spam with one minute? Oh, I think I don't know. Maybe we just didn't have that many people in the chat. Uh, the wording is okay. I love you, man. I love you, Brett. You're a funny guy. All right. Can we not die here? That'd be so sad if I lost to a hog rider for no reason. It's not going to kill me, right? Wait, the witch is still alive. That's kind of bad, guys. Am I dead? I dead to an evolved witch. This just die, please. Thank god, man. I did not know if I was going to die or not. It just kept healing up. I was like, I'm going to die today. What did he say, though? I'm not going to read it. It was a little bit perverted. A little bit edgy. Uh, what are we doing here? Maybe we can go like uh Inferno Dragon Barrel Earthquake works or does it not? Uh, I probably wouldn't. I would just run Hog Rider. I think Hog Rider is fine. Um, I like Hog Rider. It's a little bit more robust and it won't die to executioners as much and mother witches. So, you know, I just prefer that, man. Hog rider right to the king tower. Thanks, buddy. Kind of annoying. This guy has got like 67 different uh, you know, ways of being annoying. Oh. Oh, he wasn't ready. He wasn't ready. Oh, dude. Imagine a universe where Hoger breaks through three buildings and a to the skeleton army. That's insane, dude. Add a fourth building. Why don't you? You need a freaking I don't know, Inferno tower in there and maybe a megaite. Maybe a Pekka next game, brother. I think I don't think you had enough sauce. I think you had enough dressing, my guy. Oh, this bowler is going to hurt his his head. Bro is going to be like, \"How did that hit my tower?\" It is too fun. All right, I'm just going to b here left. This is easy. He's going to hog right and it's not going to do anything. How did I know? It's almost as if I play this game too much. It's almost as if I knew exactly what Hobie was going to do. Waluigi. All right, we're just going to Earthquake here and then uh get the free damage and then bowler into that because it's a really good play and then uh cleans everything up for free. That's five elixir just eats everything. He's going to delete his entire bank account on this man. He's he's just he's getting after it to a different degree. They back. Why not? Wow. I mean, this is going great. Think that this challenge just takes way too long. I I'm not going to lie, this challenge should take like a solid 30 minutes less if you win most of your games. The fact that it's taking this long is insane, y'all. Like, even if you're a past trial player, watching this challenge video probably helps you so much because it makes you like win faster and you wouldn't be spending your entire lifespan doing it. Imagine Supercell makes the challenges purposely long so that everyone has to like buy the emote instead of uh playing it out. It's but also it's people like this guy that make the challenge go long. Like it's half his fault for putting in a Tesla in a threeb building deck already and then deciding to like I don't know man. Like he made this challenge unnecessarily more annoying. He was he was the He was the annoying person that no one wanted to see. It was him. It was him all along. He was him. Also, why would you ever run evolve witch in this m uh like this this game mode? Like bowler is everywhere. Evolve Witch is a great card. It is actually the best card in the game. But where Bowler is an automatic include in the deck, I probably wouldn't run Evolve Witch as one of my evolutions. Just got to hear it out, you know, like just got to say it. Got to scream it for my lungs. Sucks. I feel safer with the hog version because I'm sure the graveyard one is great, too. Yeah, that's why I gave you guys two options. Is this deck good for normal games? No, this is not a normal like the title and thumbnail is like best deck for the challenge. It's specifically very geared for the challenge with tips tailored for that. This would definitely uh not be a deck that I would recommend playing in regular games. You don't have a way to break through buildings. It's not like you reliably can kill electro dragon. Like this is specifically built for a meta where people are not playing cards that are super scary that you would see very frequently. you know, like I don't think you're going to see elixir golem electro dragon ever. And you'll see that in regular games, you know, so yeah, just keep that in mind. Like a lot of these challenges are tailored built to beat the challenge. Just a tease. Just a little tease of the the log and the hogammer. Yo. Oh, the stationary box. He says, \"A small investment in your Vegas success. Whether it's blackjack or interpretive arts, just remember just win. I love you, man. I love you. Stationary box. Thank you. Yo, I'm going. So, the only gamble that I think I'm actually going to do cuz I've never gambled in my entire life is I think I'm going to do a coin flip for Pokemon cards. I think I will do that for content because it gets more engagement. Like you're watching like gambling or whatever. People people watch that more frequently cuz there's like you're doing a deal it's like ah the deal is going to be like at 90% of the card value. It's not that cool. But if you do a card deal, it's like 90% to it goes to 100% of value. you're pay 100% or 70%. You know, that's that's like few hundred dollar difference or something. People would freak out, you know, like people watch that. I'm I don't think I'm going to do a zero to 5,000, but I'm going to try to So, one of my friends is really rich. I think we're going to try to get him to do like some big gamble because he doesn't really care about money. So, we'll see what happens there. He might he might do some insane gamble and that would be really really cool to watch for content especially. But um dude, for me I I will I I will manifest the just win luck and I hope I can win. Um it'll be super cool. I I remember um I don't know just in general like gambling. I just get so scared of it because I know this odds are stacked against me so I never do it. I like look at that I'm like I'm probably gonna lose so I run away because I I I think about like the money that I could be spending on videos or other things and I'm like no I can't like bro that's like a nice dintifong dinner or like a uh whatever. But I don't know. I think for for content I can justify it a little bit more. Um cuz I know that the retention rate of videos will go up. You guys like how I'm just like honestly telling you like my thought process about that type of stuff. That's the only reason I actually would get for gamble. It's for retention rate of videos going up. Is that a little bit pathetic? Y'all let me know. Y'all let me know. Or do you think that's okay? Do you think that's more realistic or do you think that's more healthy to know that I'm probably going to lose if I try to gamble and then I won't gamble because of that? Okay. Am I getting destroyed? I think I'm losing. This guy is just played better than me or I'm just playing like an idiot. I don't know. Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. What the hell? Oh my gosh. Just win. Never mind. Just win, my dudes. That was like a 2,000 HP tower. What the hell just happened there? That was probably the best way to end. Yo, I think the Vegas luck is already rolling in. We We have to take a look at how much tower health he lost in 2 seconds. That was it. What the hell happened there? That was insane. That was the best way to end the stream, too, guys. Like, what the actual hell? Did he like go AFK thinking he won the game? Like right here, I think he thought he won. I was in shambles. I was at 1,900 HP. All I had was a Bowler at him and he had an evolve, firecracker, hog rider. The firecracker hit my tower. He's got a hog. I I don't even have a tombstone spawning up cuz my tombstone's on the left side. So I can't spawn another tombstone. Dude, he got my tower down to 500. No, 300. No, 260. And his tower, where was it? It was at 2,800. My tower was at 200 HP. Okay, if I was him, all I would have done, straight up, skeletons up top, pull back the Valkyrie and the the the knight, right? And then you Valkyrie on top of the the knight and the the the Valkyrie for me. But he didn't skeletons up top. He had the elixir. He's just so mesmerized by the sauce. Then he's just freaking out. He's sitting there. He's like, \"Log, I'm going to drop everything.\" He just didn't get it down in time. Always skeletons up top to kite things back and then, you know, you're going to stop stuff because you get more breathing room to drop your cards later on. If you wait till the units are at your tower, at your doorstep, and you try to drop stuff, it's not going to work. You're just going to lose your tower like that guy. Yeah, it was an awesome win. Hell yeah. We lost one game today. I didn't play super well in that game, and the guy was just really good. I don't know who this was, but yeah, like very good player. Probably mini account. Um, and guy was okayish. Uh, I didn't just didn't really look in the game at play that one very well. Um, but yeah, this guy I think was very good. I don't know who the heck that was, but that guy was very, very good at the game. Anyway, we got the challenge. We showed the decks. Let me know down below in the comment section if this helps you out. And please dominate the challenge for me. You know, just win. As Mr. Stationary Box said, that is us a sub. We got to make slogan or merch with just just win. Is your hair color natural? Yeah. It's weird. It's like dirty blonde. It's not quite blonde. It's not quite brown. It's like it is natural. And especially when I go out in the sun, it like becomes more blonde. So it you guys get ready. I'm going to evolve. I'm going to go Super Saiyan. But yeah, here are the two decks. Again, if you want to take a look at them, let me know how it goes down below in the comment section. Drop a like on the video if you want to support me for free. And make sure to check out the pin comment because I did a tier list breaking down all the evolutions in Clash Royale from worst to first. I talked about which ones I thought were the best and the worst in Clash Royale. So, if you want to see which evolutions are worth upgrading and what are the best ones to play, definitely check out the pin comment cuz I will show you guys the ones are like insanely good. So, yeah, check those out. I got you guys. And, uh, that video will be in the pin comment for everyone to watch. It is a long-term video that people will get a ton of like recognition and views on, so I think it's going to do great then. But, yeah, check out that video. Best evolutions in Clash Royale. No matter when or where you're watching, I hope you have an amazing rest of your day and get hyped for some crazy stories from Vegas, guys, cuz we're going to we're going to be back here on Sunday or Monday. Yeah, I'll be back on Sunday and uh it's like a two-day trip. So, it's insane that we're coming back at like 10 p.m. on Sunday and then uh I I'll be back on Monday to stream you guys. Then, I have two videos lined up for you while I'm gone. Peace. Check out the pin comment and uh yeah, see you soon. Love you."
