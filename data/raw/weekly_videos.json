    "transcript": "Sencio, welcome to a brand new humble video where boss and me are going to do a brand new tier list of this weather. Let's go. Um, so we choose this type of format where you have like icons are different. Um, I like personally more. Uh, let's see what we do with categories. But first of all, this slightly here. Let's just cut it off. It's D or E. No, like we never use and average. Not played a lot. It's like last option as nutty tank. Uh, Nita for me is like average or B. Yeah. For now, I will leave it C. Same same. It's only like drile counter apparently in this meta. It's pretty hard to play. Cold is only high. So, where do you put him? I would put it C. Sure. It's literally only high. We just can't move it then. Uh, bull is on average for me. Maybe even we uh Brock forget change. I will put I'm fine with I was going to put it be, but it just has so many contests. Yeah, two too different people for Primo above average for me. Yeah, it's me I think already. Yeah, I think it's pretty strong with the iPad and it's used a lot. I'm down for that. Also, Barry counter now that Barry came back. Didn't matter. He came back from it as well, especially like during deals. Um, Poco for me is a high A. Same same. Rosa is E. Yeah, Jess is D. Jess is D. Can be used sometimes, but we never do. Dynam, I will put it B. B. He's not that much use as partly because every Yeah, we have we have Jay Young as well which is like really speed meta. Okay, so I'm fine with that. Thick I don't know. We haven't played him in so long though. I will put it just B or C. No, we'll see. I will put it C. All right, I will put him top of C. Um A bit. A bit I think it's C C. He's getting played more than Tik Tok. I think it will be he's getting picked around with dynamite in my opinion for me be like really good gem carry really good genie counter as well for knockout for out the map uh generally gem carry nice I think it's fine now ro CB B I think can be used sometimes but not that much so yeah D for me is B or A especially heist is so broken I mean he's broken in heist is a buster counter that is top tier too so I will put it a low A for now even there for now uh Penn is like under Yeah, it's perfect category for her. Jackie is like B for me. Be high. Be high. I think even A, but not for now. Yeah, it depends. People force her too much. They just play into everything, but you can only play against other tanks like Buster, which is like prime jacking match up or like Barry. Gash has a sniper just now. Uh, we're playing it a lot though. We have like sniper maps to lock right now. I think it's at least B. Yeah, it's B 100%. Put them a bit higher. It's always like one of the best times you can go both A or S. of a high, but let's see how many boards we have on. We will change it later. Don't worry. Uh M is like under average. Yeah, not good. It's fine. Sometimes against pogo comps, poker tanks comps, but just only against pogo. Yeah, that's it. Um it's too I mean we didn't take a lot. Yeah, the the hypercharge level was actually a bit too much I think. So I don't know. I would hit B high for now. Yeah, we can change it. Uh Piper, uh I will go with say low. Yeah, low A is basic. Pam for hypercharge. That's an interesting one. I honestly we didn't test out. She also got the damage buff. We didn't play her too much. But the hypercharge isn't in the game yet. It's going to come out in the future, which is quite sad. So, don't know yet. Yeah, it's not out yet. I think hyp she can be quite strong. But right now, she's average for me. Yeah, for now it's C. But that will with hyper will be. Yeah, with hyper she at least. Frank for me is B or A. Like really nice tank. Yeah, she's a really nice tank. She can call tank if you go. Maybe it's D. B, you think? Yeah. Okay. I'll put it a too, but for now leave it. For now, leave it as uh I need B. Yeah, I'm fine with that. It's probably a bit lower. Yeah, just cont. No, I mean can be used though. What do we use him? What do we play last time? Except pit stop. Except pit stop. That is not I mean against against throwers. Never mind. We don't go. Never mind. No, not the easy way to work. Okay. Okay. Um card for me is A or B. A. For me, it's A. Okay. Low A. I think the tanks are a bit too annoying for me. Only hung though. Griff hyper. We broken hyper. It's not going to get a lot of value if you don't face tanks. Above average for sure. I don't know if he's A or not. Uh no, it's B. Okay. Uh he got an hyper and he still isn't getting picked. So like under average I don't know. You choose. I I think under average like he got hyper. It's only possible pick on knockout against a sprout. That's the only way I would pick him currently. Bonnie is an interesting one. I think new mechanic. I think she's average nowadays. She can be put the T. I will put the T. Yeah, it's like before cold I think. Um, same for G honestly. Yeah, I agree. Colette even weaker heist change honestly. Like we literally had a scrim hypercharge did like half the damage which is crazy. I think it's C. Yeah. Yeah. Uh, Bell is A for me. Really strong A. Banger sniper like always always there. Ash is really good hand counter. Really good counter. High B or a low high B for now. Yeah, same. Um, it's again B. Yeah, high B. Yeah, some E. hypert got destroyed. Yeah. So much but even then without like you always feed enemies and especially now for hyper charge meta you're basically running them down and giving them hype for free for free and that's not what you want. Many for me is A. I will put a B though. You put a B or let's give a top for B for now. Um I'm I'm going to um I will put a D. You put a D. Yeah. Okay. Let's leave a D. We have F. We should have stop. Yeah. Yeah. Top. He just runs it down all the time. Hyper to heal his shield. It's just too annoying with possible synergies we have from him with poke with barrier comps. It's just too much. Max Jay Young everything. Uh Pearl is an interesting one. I don't know. Below or C high below them. Larry is not picked a lot but it's not that bad. But it's like this. It's B. It's okay. Angelo. O I will put it as honestly. Every sniper map you use and for every everyone even when I cover canyons. Okay. Barry is S in my opinion. I will put it today. Uh A I think yes. I mean it has a lot of countries though. I mean but not B doesn't count. What what does it counter? Lou L Hank. Not Hank. No. Yeah. I disagree because if you if they go Hank, you go Barry Frank and you win. I disagree. Okay, just leave it then. But I will put A. Sh again. Kia. Nice assassin. Me got nerfed a lot. Um it's only the gadget. I think C. I'm fine with C. Going to put him double C. It's only the gadget that as well. Your Mortis is really situational. Yeah, if you have an IP, you're going to kill them. It's going to be useless. Enough of B. Yeah, like that. Uh paid way more. Yeah, above average. Okay, I'm fine with that. Genie A at least. Hey, C is S. Yeah, I agree actually with that one. She got back in the meta now. I don't know why exactly. I guess because of Yeah, I don't know. But she got back in the meta. Uh P is C or D. Maybe D. I think I think D. I think D. Unfortunately, poor Mr. P, man. Po Mr. P. It was broken before though. Yeah, it was broken. And no, it's not anymore. I don't know. It's too many tanks that are rushing it down. Probably C. C again. Nice to have, but you cannot always play him. Byron is B for me at least. Maybe it's a it's a Okay. G is still really strong. Speak for me is A still as well. Yeah, same is A again. I would like low A. The low the lowest one. Rough. Rough is high B for me. I agree. Bus. Yeah, we'll see. Yeah. B again. Low B. It's nice to have sometimes, but it's not always the best. So, an I will put D. Yeah, I agree. No. E all the way down. No, you're getting paid on shooting star sometimes. At least he's getting played unlike other ones. I like rules on board, you know. I mean, we played holy on haste one time on pit stop on pit stop. It's pit stop. Pit stop is pit stop. It's a different matter. I'll put him here. I think he can have some e. Yeah, so so middle me like this. Janet is a s. No, I don't think yes. I don't think before was before anymore. Maybe not now. I live a I love him as a candy counter. Um but I don't think he's anything anything of that. I'll put him like here. Yeah. Oh, it just be bast. That's S. You think? Not a no. I mean you just get countered by two growers. Jackie and H. What do you pick? I mean on that you get rid of that just going to get hypers for free. Sure. Sure. Great. A yeah if you have him on hot song it's basically guaranteed to win and great bustar combo as well as super strong art. One of a really good snip. He's getting a bit less right now, but I think a Mandy or LT, which one is better? I like Mandy more. I prefer LT because of that corner tank. But for me, Mandy is A. Honestly, if we put RT on A, we should put Mandy A, too. All right, there you go. Willow got the hyper charge now. Not that it's going to do anything for it though. Um, it's a really nice thrower if you want to be sure against max comps or like aggressive comps. I think it's C or B. B. Yeah, I like that. Perfect. Um, well, we're not going to talk. I mean, we're not going to talk much about that. I mean, it's only heist and it's only highest. How was it E? E. Yeah. Okay. This just it's like heist. Uh, Charlie really overrated in my opinion from from Asia right now. Played a lot of months final. My last one. Got completely stomped on that final. I think D or C. Yeah, I think C is fine. C is fine. It's an average baller. It's not the best, but I wouldn't like go in first. Miko got a buff. Everyone played him a lot in ranked especially in some scrums as well. Especially his base race in in heist. I don't know about it now. Like I think it just see high. Yeah, I agree. But not it doesn't go to B. No, he's not like a pick always, but it can be nice to play. Melody is like B or A for me. Which one you think? We're not getting that much melody. Lastly, normally we play max melody most of the time. Leave it be for now. Okay. High B. Yeah. Uh Lily hypercharge. Honestly, you get hyper charge really fast. I quite like it. I will go A honestly. Yeah, I'm down for that. Put a low low A though. Okay. Uh Clancy have a charge does not matter anything. The only way you go Clansancy is if you have a free match up. So like average. Yep. I don't see I would say it's B or A. He's getting played more than than T. Yeah, because it counters a lot of Yeah, especially Ki K a lot on a lot of B maps. So I think I'm fine with putting him low of A. Okay. Even though he's not always a best pick, but he's really nice pick. Uh Juju. Okay. A them still getting played quite a lot. Ollie is A or S for me. I will go S. It's just way too broken. Things is A or A. I think it's not broken. It's it's not broken, but it's really it's really so good. It's so safe. Lumis S. Yeah. Uh J is SP getting picked more actually. It's B. I think. Yeah, I think it's high B as well, though. I'm down for that. Crow. Um Crow, it got buffed, but not much. Your choice. Just put it here. Okay. You're not going to see it in bro. You're not going to see it anywhere that is not haste. So Leon is getting played quite a lot in bounty as sniper counter. I will put a bit low. Okay. Uh Sandy is I don't see he fell out of the meta somehow. Yeah, they just run it down. Let's see. Let's see. Okay. Um Amber with no the hypercharge is really broken. It's so broken. It's basically better hyper. So I put it low again. Yeah, I'm fine with that. It's it's getting played more and more right now. So let's see how that develops. But yeah, me we're playing a lot of me just because you're playing me bar a lot. Yeah. So I think B is like fine. Uh search is B. C. Yeah. You fine with low lows of B? I'm fine, too. No, whatever. We have too much on B. Let's go see. Uh Chester is uh Cordelius above average. Yeah, sure. This is a lot of like pre stuff, but nothing else. Yeah, just like hard tanks, I guess. Kit is an interesting one. I will go for A. If you know how to use Kit, it's so annoying in every single map. It's so hard to use. So, like you do one mistake, you use those. But yeah. Yeah, but it's um Draco is the hot zone king. A Okay. Ki is broken and we will just assume that Kaza will be broken as well. Yeah, like the order for me will be Lumi before Kenji, Kenji, Jay Young. These are like the top three. I will put Kenji J and Kumi. You think Lumi last? Yeah. From top three. So we compromise and we put in the middle. Okay. I just think Kenji is first. Anything that we should still should change at the end. I think S is like pretty fit the meta. Yeah. Yeah. The bow I think the needs to be. I think between that bonus at the high ins is not that good. Looks nice. Looks nice. Car looks nice. Juju looks nice. Can't be a bit higher. Honestly, Griffith for hyper might be A. What do you think? No, you like you're so slow to get the pictures and it's just not that good. Like it's good. They only get like two kills. Takes too long to get it. Okay. Ctier don't see much that I prefer there. It just counters of two brawlers or three Bers and that's it. Dtier as well. I wouldn't could put the M higher if you want just for vocal counter but yeah that's fantastic. Uh well that's not tier list. We have basically the top rollers uh the ST brawlers which you really like first pick on most of the maps here. Kaz, which when she comes out, Kenji, Lumi, Jay Young, the top three brawlers, and then in no order B, Barry, Chester, Hank, Buster, Angelum, Ollie just played around all the maps currently. Really, really annoying. Um at the bottom here, you have used Brawers, which you should avoid. Um which is just stuck. You should never pick them honestly. Just never don't go them. Uh and then you have like good better brawlers, which you can always go like two, three on most of the maps. Most notably, you can see a lot of snipers here. That's mostly because they can play the snipers only like bounty knockout, but then also like gem grip open maps that will always be fine. Um, and hot zone open maps like open zone for example, really open map. Snipers thrive there as well, especially Lola pretty good there as well. There's some meta brawlers. Then BTR are some solid choices that you can go most of the time. Um, not the main choice. Griff, for example, is mostly against tanks. You would not like to pick Griff into like a control comp because you will never get your hypercharge, but if you get your hypercharge, you will get insane value. Uh, and that's basically mostly this category that goes like if you have a insane matchup that dollar is going to be insane. Ct is like, yeah, can work. Not our first choice. Can work, works, I guess. Don't shouldn't usually pick him. Um, DT is like, yeah, it's my last choice to go if it works. Uh, E tier is just, yeah, don't pick him. It's useless. It's not the worst. Like, it's playable, but always going to be like bad pick. That's how it is for Humble for the meta of the new hypercharges that come out with Lily Batch. I hope you enjoyed it. I hope this will help you in your future rank push. I hope they change rank does well with that. Thank you everyone for watching. I really appreciate it. And see you guys on the next video. Bye-bye."

    "title": "*TIER LIST* DEL META DE BRAWL STARS DE MAYO",
    "creator": "Rol - Brawl Stars Competitivo",
    "transcript": "Si te gusta saber meta de Brawl Stars, tranquilo, porque voy a traerte la mejor tierlist de todo YouTube. ¿Y por qué es la mejor tierlist que vas a encontrar en todo YouTube? Pues bueno, para el que no me conozca, hola, yo soy Roll, soy entrenador profesional de Brawl Stars para Timer Etics y estoy entrenando y preparándome muchísimo los partidos que se están viniendo estos días. Ya sabéis que estos viendo a ver si se hace algún cambio, si no, bueno, está todo un poquito en el aire, pero llevamos entrenando muchísimo. Y para el que no me conozca de mi pasado, yo soy entrenador profesional de Brawl Stars. Vamos, desde que empezó el competitivo, llevo siendo profesional cuatro últimos años y he clasificado a los últimos cuatro mundiales, pero esto no empieza ahí. Llevo jugando desde hace mucho más y siendo entrenador mucho más en equipos más pequeños como Artic Gaming, Team Queso. Y bueno, también he pasado por equipos como Tribe Gaming, AC Milan Class, eh Food Esports y ahora estamos en Teamis. Así que bueno, sin hacernos más espera, vamos a ir con la tierlist. Empezamos con los brawlers especiales, super especiales, épicos, míticos, legendarios y así avanzando hasta el final. Y dado si queréis encontrar algún problema exacto, solamente tenéis que saber su rareza e ir directamente a esa parte del vídeo. Así que empezamos. Vale, chicos, si queréis una aproximación de cómo va a ser esto, digamos que en ese van a estar los brawlers más rotos, los que están más fuertes del meta y que probablemente tenáis que mejorar en A. los siguientes que también está muy fuerte, pero no están tan rotos como para ser FPC siempre, ya me entendéis, ¿no? Como que está muy muy bien el meta, pero tampoco tanto. En B y en C estarán los brawlers que están normal en el meta, ni arriba ni abajo. Se pueden jugar depende de la situación y puede ser que tengan unos problemers mejores que ellos mismos en ese o en A. Y en D y E los brablers que no debería jugar y en E, los que son injugables prácticamente o que no se ven apenas en situaciones. Así que bueno, vamos a empezar. Ya sabéis que voy a dedicar una dos frases a cada brawler más o menos para que tengáis una idea aproximada de cómo está en el meta. Vale, empezamos con Sell primer brawler, brawler que todo el mundo tiene nada más desbloquear el juego y por desgracia se va a ir a tier F. Hay muchos, es un antitanque que debería parar tanques y sin embarco estamos dando cuenta en el meta que hay muchos tanques que pueden ganar la es una locura pero es real, así que el que se va a ir a tier F, no hace suición de antitanque a la perfección hay mejores problemas, así que se va a quedar ahí. Nita, buen antitanque. Esto sí es un buen ejemplo antitanque, no de los mejores del meta, pero sí que está bastante bien en ciertos mapas, así que yo la voy a poner directamente en cierpe sin ningún miedo. Me parece que está siendo bastante buena en ciertas situaciones. La hace counter no solo a brawlers eh tanques, sino también le hace counters a otros brawlers como Tara. Eh, cuando pone el oso hay muchos brawlers que lo pasan muy muy mal. Así que esta Nita que sair a TRB Colt no se está viendo mucho, pero sí que hay muchos papás de he de lo mejor que puedes piquear, así que lo voy a poner en tier C. No es muy muy bueno, pero tampoco es muy muy malo. Lo dejamos en tierce que ahí está perfectamente Bull, uno de los peores tanques del juego. Probablemente no tiene lo que viene siendo una manera de aguantar vivo, así que lo vamos a dejar en tierte. Lo dejamos ahí y que no salga. Vale, chicos, pasamos a tier, eh, perdón, pasamos a Brock, que se va a meter con Colt. Se ve en alguna situación o bueno, puede que no, eh. Creo que Brock lo voy a mandar incluso a Tierde con Bull. Le falta algo, ¿no creéis que no se está viendo apenas nada? Le hace counter muchísimo brawlers, eh, snipers también los tanques, velocidades como max. Lo vamos a dejar en tier D, no lo estoy viendo absolutamente nada. El primo tier C brawler bastante decente para hacer counter a otro tanques, perdón, pero no está entre lo más jugado. Barley. Barley quizás sea el primer brawler que va a mover a tier A. Eh, me parece un brawler con hipercarga muy muy bueno. Se ve muchos mapas y puede hacerle counter a muchísimos brawlers. También hace counter algunos throwers como puede ser Berry para fidearse muchísimo y cargar muchísimas ultiscargas. La voy a dejar ahí en tier a poco otro brother que se va tier A. Se ve bastante, te cambia el meta, ¿eh? Bueno, quizás está entre tiera y tier B, quizás no llega tanto a tiera. Lo vamos a dejar en tier B. Creo que es un que no se ve tanto como para ponerlo en tiera, pero sí que es muy bueno en muchos mapas, así que de momento lo dejamos ahí. Rosa brawler bastante malillo. Creo que lo voy a dejar en tier D. Creo que no lo voy a subir a C de momento. Se puede ver, sí se puede ver. Para mí no es el mejor player del mundo y creo que le ayuda mucho es el poder poner tantos arbustos, pero hay tantos antidankers y tiene una manera tan difícil de acercarse al rival es que por lo menos el pivo puede saltar. Bull incluso puede ir en línea recta, pero es que Rosa no tiene nada para acercarse, así que de momento le voy a poner en tierde. Pasamos con Jessie que se está viendo algo, pero tampoco mucho le voy a poner en tierc. Se va a ver. Sí, pero tampoco una locura. Le percarga todavía no sigue, no termina de destacar. De momento lo vamos a dejar en tierce. Dynamike a tierce también se puede ver, sí, pero no es el mejor thrower ni de coña. Se queda un poquito atrás, así que de momento lo ponemos ahí. Tic, lo vamos a subir a tier B. Es un brawler asequible, se puede jugar, no está tan mal, pero situaciones muy exactas y sobre todo en bounty y en y enqueo se ve bastante, por eso lo voy a subir un poquito más. 8 bit lo vamos a dejar en tier C o tier B, no va a ser C, en plan, se puede ver en situaciones muy exactas, pero solo lo estamos viendo en gemas, ya ni siquiera lo estamos viendo en mapas de he, así que se va a quedar ahí rico tier B antitanque bastante bueno siempre y cuando tengas el mapa y el momento donde jugarlo, también la habilidad personaje con bastante habilidad y que no todo el mundo puede jugarlo, eh, se puede complicar un poco. Darril, un buen tanque. Ahora sí que sí lo vamos a dejar en tier B. Se puede ver, está bastante bien, pero es cierto que hay mucha gente que no lo termina de jugar, así que de momento tier B no lo vas a subir mucho más. Penny, uf, Penny, tengo mis dudas, eh, lo había estado pensando antes, no sé si apuntado algo. Creo que le voy a dejar en tierce, no termina de estar tan bien. Le han bajado bastante m el mortero, tal, no sé, no lo termino de ver. De momento lo vamos a dejar en tier C, pero lo podrías subir un poquito a tier B. Carl, indiscutible. Tier A, muy muy buen brawler. a pesar de los nerfeos que está recibiendo, sigue siendo lo mejor que puede jugar en el meta. Jacki, ojo porque Jacki sube bastante, no solo por Jacki Casket, sino también por el buff a ciertos brawlers que la deja eh muy alta. Por ejemplo, es un brawler que hace counter a brawlers meta como Kenji, como Sade, por lo tanto ha subido bastante, estaría entre A y B, eh, tendría que pensármelo bastante. También le hace Counter Bter, es que es un brawler muy meta, chicos. Creo que lo voy a poner en A. Eh, estaba dudando si ponerla en B o en A, pero al ver que es un brawler que está baneando todo el mundo, porque si quieres piquear Baster, Sate o Kenji, es un brawler que tienes que banear sí o sí, entonces lo voy a dejar entiera mucho ojo. Está Yai que viene fuerte, pero es verdad que también se puede bajar a eh un poquito ya cada uno decisión de cada uno. Yo de momento lo voy a poner aquí Gus y y tiera o tier, ¿qué decís vosotros? Yo lo voy a poner en tier B. La hipercarga me pensaba que iba a ser mucho mejor, pero la verdad es que no hace nada, no cambia la partida como otras hipercargas. Lo dejo en TierP, sigue estando decente en ciertos mapas, pero no es lo mejor que vais a encontrar. Bo, Bo, que se va directo al tier A. Brawler con rango, brawler con daño, me gusta bastante. De momento lo vamos a dejar aquí muy muy top. Eh, MZ eh pensando eh pensando pensamientos, la voy a dejar en tier D o C. Es que no le estoy viendo nada. No lo he visto ni una vez en competitivo desde que empezó el año. Le falta algo, no sé qué es, pero algo le falta. Lo voy a dejar en cierte. Bueno, sí se ha visto en Latinoamérica, pero en Europa yo personalmente ningún entreno ni nada, así que lo voy a dejar ahí. ST puede ser que siga en tier A, puede ser que lo podamos bajar incluso a tier B. Yo de momento lo dejo en Tier A. Eh, sigue estando bastante okay y se es un brawler muy muy completo. Eh, Piper que se va a ir a tier. Sí, Tiera o Tier Tier A, ¿no? ¿Qué tipo otro? Yo es que no sé si tiera o tier B está quizás no es de lo mejor. Vamos a decir que en tier S están los mejores br del meta, ¿no? Lo que es indiscutiblemente bueno y en tiera que se pueden jugar en casi todos los mapas. Mirad como esto lo podemos jugar en casi todo, pero es verdad que Piper no se puede jugar en todos los mapas, solamente en bounty tal, noqueo, alguno de he vas a dejar en B. Está muy bien el meta, pero no está entre lo mejor. Pam, que ha subido bastante. Le voy a dejar en tier A. La estoy viendo muy muy fuerte. La estoy viendo de lo mejor que hay. Y quizás sí que la ponga en el tier A. Sí, lo vamos a dejar ahí porque se está moviendo bastante. Frank, lo vamos a poner en tier C. No es de lo mejor, pero sí es verdad que se va a tirar ciertos tanques meta también. Entonces, bueno, tías de justicia. Vivi, Bibi, no la termino de ver, la vamos a dejar en tier D. No termina de encajar. Yo de momento le voy a poner aquí, incluso voy a hacer una modificación, chicos, y voy a mover a Bull a TRF, chicos. Creo que va a haber muy poco probable en TRF. Al final creo que BR está haciendo un buen intento en subir los probes bajos y cada vez están más igualados. De momento lo vamos a dejar en tier Full y está vive en tier D. Bea podría estar perfectamente en tier S, me parece a mí, ¿eh? Pero la vamos a bajar a tiera. Creo que se puede ver en tier S. Es un brawler muy completo, muchas veces en FPCK indiscutible y baneo. Entonces, lo vamos a dejar este tier A, pero podría ser perfectamente un tier eh eh de los mejores antitanques que podemos ver debido a la cantidad de mapas abiertos que hay. Nani no termina de estar bien. Se ve muy poco. Vamos a dejar el tier Clemente para hacer counter a ciertos brawlers. No me encaja, no me encaja, oye. No, no deía que encajarme. Edgar, pues Edgar no está mal, ¿eh? Estaría entre B y C. Lo voy a dejar en C, pero ojo, porque se puede llegar a ver más, ¿eh? Hubo un tiempo en que Edgar estaba tiers, chicos, o Tier Globus y la gente no se lo creía, pero sí, Edgar que sale del pozo, se queda en tier C. Griff, muy bien y cada vez mejor debido a esta hipercarga que le van a poner. Creo que lo voy a poner incluso en tier B. Lo veo un poquito mejor que los jugador que los probable de tier C. Está ahí, ahí lo vamos a dejar aquí. Creo que se puede ver bastantes mapas y cuando le meta el piccar que va a subir un montón. Grom lo vamos a dejar en tier C. No es el mejor thrower, pero si tienes habilidad con él puede cambiar la partida. Está claro. Bonnie, Bonnie se está viendo bastante ahora. El bufado, lo voy a dejar en tier B. Ahora se ve en Hair, se puede ver en bounty, incluso en noqueo en algún mapilla. Lo veo bastante asequible. La vamos a dejar en tier B. Los eh main bonnie que pueden sonreír porque la verdad que está bastante fuerte. Gale se va a ir a tier B, quizás sea el mejor full antitanque. Si tiene delante muchos antitanques, lo podría bajar a C, pero bueno, yo lo voy a dejar en tier B. Colet bastante regulera, no se está viendo que si nada, hay bastante counter, lo voy a dejar de momento en tier C, pero podríamos ponerlo en tier B perfect y en tier D incluso. Puede que también. Bell muy completo. Lo vamos a dejar en tier A. Lo veo muy muy top y cada vez se ve de más as podría estar en A, pero lo voy a dejar en B. Creo que hay muchos antitanques en este met, pero ojo porque podríamos subirlo perfectamente a tierra. Yo de momento lo voy a dejar en tier B. Lola, Lola no está mal. Podríamos dejarlo en tier C. Empezamos a abrir ya el doble reglón en tier C. No la termino de ver. Le falta algo, no sé, como que algo todavía me falta para esta Lola. Sam, muy mal. La gent F. Pensábamos que leer carga iba a cambiar el meta, no lo hizo y de hecho se quedó bastante estancado. Lo vamos a dejar a Sama ahí en ese tier F. Mandy, Mandy no está nada mal, ¿eh? Creo que le voy a poner en tier C o D. Creo que le voy a poner en B. En C, perdón. No se está viendo tanto. No está mal. La hipercarga de hecho Bounty es de lo mejor que puedes tener y si eres buenam mandandy, puedes carrilear la partida entera, pero yo le voy a ver en tier C. Recordemos que tier B y tier C son como los brawlers más igualados, los que están bien de meta y no tienen que estar ni muy arriba ni muy abajo. Así que es un brawler que lo veo bien, no creo que haya que nerfearla ni bufarla. Está bien ahí. Quita un pequeño buff, pero muy muy pequeño. Me cada vez me gusta más. Incluso lo voy a poner en tier B. Creo que es un antitanque muy completo, de los pocos antitanques que puede parar a como Jacki, así que se va a quedar ahí. Hank, Hank de mi vida. Perdonad, perdonad por esto que voy a hacer, pero lo voy a poner en tieres. Me parece de los mejores probes que hay ahora mismo, eh, muy completo, difícil de conterear, eh, se ven todos los mapas. Hank es nuestro primer tier S porque está bastante completo. Pe que se va a ir a tier C. Ni fu ni fa se puede ver en algunos mapas, pero tampoco es lo mejor. Larry, Lauri, tier B me parecen completos, no son los mejores throwers, pero lo vamos a dejar en tier B. Y ojo porque empezamos a meternos en los braules ya más interesantes. Angelo, segundo brawler en su vida TS muy muy bueno, el mejor sniper posible hace counter incluso a Throwes porque puede atravesar y de un disparo con ulti puede cargarse a muchos. Así que este Angel se queda en tier S. Berry, muy buen brawler, lo vamos a dejar en tier A, se está viendo cada vez más y, incluso se podría bajar a tier B, pero creo que está bastante bien ahí, me gusta mucho y creo que da para hacer muchísimas estrategias, así que lo vamos a dejar en tier A. Sade, entre tier A y tier B. Hm, creo que le dejar en Tierb simplemente porque hay momentos en los que es muy difícil que este rol se meta en ciertos mapas por la cantidad de mapas abiertos que hay. Así que lo vamos a dejar en Tier B, pero está muy muy bien. Si sabéis jugarlo está genial. MEL estaría entre tier S y tier A. Lo voy a dejar en tier A. Creo que no llega a ser tan tiers. No llega a ser para tanto, pero lo vamos a poner ahí. Mortis lo estoy viendo cada vez mejor, ¿eh? Lo vamos a dejar en tier B. No llega a ser de A, pero casi. Eh, lo veo muy muy top. Creo que puede dar la vuelta a muchas partidas y un buen Mortis ahora mismo puede carrilear el meta. Tara que le vamos a poner en tiera. Me parece muy buen brawler, muy buen antitanques ahora que hay muchos tanques y, incluso en gemas la veo un pck casi obligatorio, incluso casi de fest pick la veo muy top, me está gustando mucho esta tarara, cada vez más es lo que estoy viendo en trenos y es un predict mío. Realmente estaría por ti en BC, pero os digo que provéis tratar en gemas porque creo que simplemente cargarle percarga y en último segundo ir a la base del rival y robarle las gemas es una locura. Así que le vamos a poner este tier A, genio también en tieras. Bueno, tier A o tier B, lo voy a poner en tier A porque creo que en mapas como Bounty, como Gema, Bounty y Noko, es lo mejor que has visto este genio en tu vida. Pero además se puede jugar en gemas, en algunos mapas abiertos de Brawl Ball se puede llegar a ver, lo vas a dejar ahí, Max, tier o tier A, eh, creo que lo voy a dejar en tier A. Está ahí, ahí lo vamos a dejar ahí porque creo que no termina de ser pues fesp en todos los mapas, ¿no? Pero podría ser de los muy altos de Topa, casi entrando en tier S. Mr. P no lo termino de ver, lo vamos a dejar en tier C. Se puede ver en algún momento, pero tampoco no. No sé la demás gente cómo lo pondrá, pero yo lo voy a poner en tierce. No, no lo termino de ver. Sprout tierce también no llega a ser el mejor thrower. Lo veo un poquito fuerita del meta. Byron. Byron está bastante bien. Lo voy a poner en tiera. A o B. A o B. Lo voy a poner en tier B. Creo que est poniendo problem en tiera. Es un problema es muy muy bueno. Podría estar en tiera perfectamente, pero para mí que le falta un poquito más todavía. Squck tier B perfectamente y bien verecido. Muy muy bueno. Low antitanque, por lo tanto se va casi directo al tier. Muy muy bien. Se está viendo bastante poco le hace bastante counter, pero este low creo que está bastante bastante bien. Es que no sé si o B, eh, quizás lo voy a mover a B. Creo que a tiene que ser solamente los que se ve en todos los mapas. Se ve en todos los mapas. Bueno, en casi todos sí, eh. Eh, cuestión de gustos, lo podéis mover a A, lo podéis mover a B, como vosotros queráis. Roofs, lo voy a poner en tier C. Se ve en ciertos mapas, pero muy muy indicados. Buff, tier B se está viendo bastante para conterar. Ciertos brawlers. Fang, lo siento, chicos, sé que no sé que os gusta mucho y sé que pensáis que está rotísimo, pero la verdad es que no. La verdad es que se quedó un poquito inútil. Lo voy a dejar en tier D. Ibi, muy buen Brawler. Lo voy a mover a tier B. No creo que llegue a estar en tier, pero ahí Janet lo vas a mover a tier. Eh, sigue siendo bastante buena, ¿eh? Bueno, incluso la podíamos bajar a tier B, ¿no? Ahí, ahí. Lo voy a dejar en tier A porque creo que puede estar bastante roto y puede ser de los mejores en ciertos mapas, pero ahí OT se lo vas a mover a tier B. Se puede ver algo, pero tampoco se está viendo mucho. Baster, tiera, indiscutible, muy brawler, probablemente de los mejores tanques del juego. Grey también. Tiera muy muy top. Eh, se está viendo mucho mapa de gemas, mucho mapa de noqueo. Casi que se podría subir a ese, pero lo voy a dejar en A porque ahí hay ahí. Eh, RT tier B perfectamente de los mejores brawlers que hay así de larga distancia. Además, antitan, ya lo veo muy muy bien. Willow se va a ir a tier Casi D. Eh, lo voy a poner en tier D, incluso creo que se puede jugar en Cones muy muy exactas de Brawl Ball, pero ya está, no se ve en nada más. D está mal, creo que cada vez se va a ver más. Lo voy a poner en tier D, pero casi que lo pongo en C. Lo voy a poner en tier D porque aún tenemos que probarlo y muchos equipos no se atreven a jugarlo. De momento se va a quedar en este tier D. Chuck. Me parece un brawler indiscutible para un mapa de Hase. Es de lo mejor que te puedes encontrar en Heista lo voy a poner en C porque solo se puede ver en He, pero digo de verdad que en he mejor brawler que puedes ver. De verdad, a lo mejor le estoy haciendo mala justicia y habrá que subirlo a B. La verdad que un buffa chak no lo queremos. Vamos a dejarlo en en Ah, no en tierce enerce en tierce. Está bien, no queremos un buff a este brawler y está bastante asequible. Charlie en cierto momento está bien. Le voy a poner en tier C. Miko ha subido bastante en el metal. La vamos a poner en tier B, chicos. Mico hace una cantidad de daño a caja muy grande. Eh, también se puede ver como asesino, mapas de bounty, noqueo, eh, se ve bastante. Lo vamos a poner en este tier B porque está bastante bastante bien. Melody se ve algo. Lo voy a hacer en Tier B. Tampoco es de lo mejor mejor, pero bueno, pues ahí está. Se está viendo bastante, ¿eh? Lili, sí, la voy a subir a ver. La hipercarga le da un pequeño buff tampoco muy grande. Quizá debería que ponerla en tier C. Voy a ponerla de momento en tier C. Bueno, vamos a ver qué tal funciona y ya veremos qué tal. Clan no lo termino de ver. Estaría en tier C o en tier D. Lo voy a poner en tier D. Creo que no es el mejor antitanque ni mucho menos, así que lo vamos a dejar por ahí en medio. Mou que se va a tier B perfectamente. La verdad que sigue estando muy bien. Yu es S o a eh o A. Eh, vamos a dejarlo en A. En A. La verdad que no termina ser de los mejores. Oli sigue siendo un tier. A sigue estando muy muy top. Finx también se va a tier. Muy bueno Lumi. Siguiente BR que entra en Tiers y de los últimos ya muy muy bien esta Lumi se está viendo bastante y sigue siendo a pesar del nerf bastante bastante buena. Y ojo porque a lo mejor me va a faltar espacio por aquí, ¿eh? Veo que está la que tiene un poquito ajustada. Spike lo vamos a dejar en tierce. No es el mejor antitanque tampoco está muy allá. Bueno, sin más. Crow, que también se va a tier C. León también se va a ir al Tier C, así que vamos a hacer un pequeño parón para reajustar la tabla. Vale, chicos, seguimos. León que se va a ir a Tier C. Se puede ver algo, pero tampoco es de lo mejor. Se queda ahí de momento. No lo termino de ver entre los mejores brawlers, la verdad. Sandy entre C y B también. Lo voy a dejar en tier C. Está bastante bien, pero sé más. Amber sube a Tiera, me parece de los mejores brawlers que podemos ver ahora mismo. Lo vamos a dejar en Tiera y creo que se va a ver bastante. Meg, bueno, está bien. Nifuá entre C y D creo que la voy a dejar en C. Creo que no termina de estar tan tan fuerte como muchos pensamos. Surch también se va al tier C. A veces se ataca mucho a la partida y no puede avanzar y se sufre bastante. Chester que se va a ir a tier ese de los mejores brawlers del meta. Muy muy top este Chester. Está bastante bastante bien. Cordilius. Cordilius que se va a ir a tier C. Se ven situaciones exactas. No termina de estar con los del A. Lo con los del B dejar en tier C. Kit que se va a tier A, sigue siendo lo mejor, sigue estando muy muy bien. Draco que lo vamos a dejar en tier B, no está entre los mejores, pero bastante seguible. Kenji que se va a tier S y Ja que se va a tir Kenji en Tier S. Simplemente por lo bien que está eh superc. La verdad que da, voy a hacer un poquito la tierlist así para que la veáis mejor. La verdad que es un brawler muy muy potente. Tiene una hipercarga que la cambia entera todo, cambia todo el juego entero. De repente todos los bos para Kenji está muy muy bien. ¿Y por qué Jaon arriba si no tiene daño rolls y tal? Lo que he visto competitivo, lo que os puedo decir es que va a ser casi siempre fespiqueado o baneado. Es lo que estoy viendo. Creo que es muy completo. Es como un Maxi un poco en el mismo equipo. Me parece una locura. Y el counter principal es crow, yo diría, por el anti el slow, el anticura, la verdad que le haría bastante counter, pero yo no me quería poner en ese. Es una predicción y ya veremos a ver qué tal me sale. Faltaría un poquito el brawler nuevo KCE, que todavía no ha salido cuando estoy grabando este vídeo, así que no sabían cómo ponerlo. Supongo que saldrá en ese porque si es un brawler ultra legendario, pues algo lo será. Así que bueno chicos, hagamos un pequeño resumen. Tier los mejores pelos del meta, los que la gente vanía para ellos están superb y siempre que estén deberíis piquearlos y deberíais subirlos si podéis. Ahí lo estáis viendo. Tier A, personajes que están muy bien en el meta, pero que no es de lo mejor, pero se ven en casi todos los mapas. Tier B, brawlers que están bien en el meta y en la situación exacta te puede cambiar la partida, así que están muy bien. Tier C, personajes que están ahí ahí en el meta, no están muy mal y la situación perfecta se pueden jugar, pero tampoco te van a cambiar mucho la partida. tier de personajes, no recomiendo jugar, pero que en momentos exactos, pues oye, puede que no vayan mal, pero no llegan a estar ahí y TRF no los piquéis porque hay mejores que ellos seguro, seguro, seguro. Así que nada más, chicos, este ha sido el vídeo. Si os ha servido, suscribiros al canal porque de verdad que se aprecia un montón las suscripciones. Y nada más, chicos. Espero que os haya ayudado este vídeo."

    "transcript": "Uh well, let's not list this. We have basically the top rollers, uh the ST brawlers, which you really should like first pick on most of the maps here. Just played around all the maps currently. Really, really annoying. Um at the bottom here, you have the use, which you should avoid. Um which is just stuck. You should never take them honestly. Just never don't go. Uh and then you have like the better brawlers, which you can always go like for free on most of the maps. Most notably, you can see a lot of snipers here. That's both good because they can play the snipers only like bounty knockout, but then also in like jungle buff maps, they will always be fine. There's some meta ballers, then BTR are some solid choices that you can go most of the time. Um, not the main choice. Uh, and that's basically mostly this category that goes like if you have a same matchup that is going to be insane. CT is like, yeah, can work. Not our first choice. Can works, I guess. Don't shouldn't usually pick them. Um, DT is like, yeah, it's my last choice to go if it works. Uh, Etier is just, yeah, don't pick them. It's useless. That's for Humble."
